<time>15 Mar 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>WITH a new year comes endless new TV and film releases, and we've compiled all of the best ones you cannot miss out on over the next week.</p><p>We can barely keep up with the incredible releases that the various streaming platforms are giving us at the moment, but we're definitely not complaining.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/16x9.jpeg><p>Here's all you need to know...</p><h2>NETFLIX</h2><h3>That ‘90s Show - Available from Thursday</h3><p>You know you’re getting old when Netflix has started making nostalgic teen sitcoms about an era that doesn’t seem that long ago. Yes, dig out your ripped jeans and Nirvana T-shirt because it’s back to the 90s for a fun and grungy spin-off from classic series That ‘70s Show.</p><p>This updated version follows the coming-of-age adventures of smart and cynical teenager Leia Forman (Callie Haverda), the daughter of Eric and Donna (Topher Grace and Laura Prepon) from That ‘70s Show.</p><p>It’s 1995, and when Leia pays a summer visit to her grandparents, Red and Kitty (played once again by Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp), she quickly bonds with the latest generation of Point Place kids, including too-cool-for-school Gwen (Ashley Aufderheide) and handsome Jay (Mace Coronel), son of That ‘70s Show’s Michael and Jackie (who were played, of course, by Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis).</p><p>With a cosily classic American studio sitcom feel, plus plenty of on-the-nose detail and jokes about the pop culture of the era, the series has enough charm to keep teens and those of a certain vintage entertained.</p><p>And if anyone still holds a special place in their heart for the original show, fear not, there’s also some exciting guest appearances from Topher and Laura, and Mila and Ashton along the way.</p><h3>Bank Of Dave - Available from Monday</h3><p>A feel-good drama based on an inspiring true story, this film stars Rory Kinnear (The Imitation Game) as Dave Fishwick, a working-class Burnley man and self-made millionaire who fought to set up a community bank to help local businesses (his name probably sounds familiar thanks to a C4 documentary back in 2012).</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in TV</h2></p><p>It's a David v Goliath battle which sees Dave take on the closed world of London's elitist financial institutions, ultimately being awarded the first new banking license to be issued in over 100 years.

Excitingly, this series opener gives you extra NCIS bang for your buck, as it concludes with an NCIS: Hawaii crossover event.</p><h3>Big Sky: Deadly Trails - finale episode on Wednesday</h3><p>The third season of this moreish and murderous crime drama from David E. Kelley (Big Little Lies, Ally McBeal) comes to a dramatic climax, with Jenny (Katheryn Winnick) and Beau (Jensen Ackles) determined to bring the Bleeding Heart Killer to justice.</p><p>Their desperation is only increased by the fact that the lives of Beau’s daughter Emily and good old Denise are on the line.
