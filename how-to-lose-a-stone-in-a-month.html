<time>08 Mar 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>YOU'VE probably already seen streams of social media posts from friends and family members proclaiming 'New Year New Me'.</p><p>Maybe it's learning a <a href=#>new language</a> or even taking up a new hobbie, but for some people, their goal this year will be to lose weight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000702285834-1.jpg><p>Data from <a href=#>The Sun's health survey</a> found that 48 per cent of readers are planning to lose weight this year, with 66 per cent saying they need to improve their overall health.</p><p>While there are many so-called <a href=#>weight loss plans</a> and hacks out there promising to get you the body of your dreams, it can be hard to know which option is best for you.</p><p>Following a December filled with food, booze and (probably) minimal movement, it’s time to kick things off and get healthy.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2021, a study by YouGov found that a whopping 48 per cent of Brits had set ‘weight loss’ as their New Year’s resolution, trouncing other new year goals which included, ‘taking up a new hobby’, ‘cutting down on drinking’, and ‘giving up smoking’.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, we know that <a href=#>sustainable weight loss</a> can take a while, and is a case of maintaining a balance of fewer calories in, more calories out.&nbsp;</p><p>However, no-one wants to be waiting months to shed the festive pounds.&nbsp;</p><p>But what if there were some simple tweaks that could actually result in weight loss of up to a stone in just four weeks?</p><p>Search ‘how to lose a stone in a month’, on Google and you’re inundated with more than 718 million page results.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a minefield out there.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Health</h2></p><p>Here are 18 expert hacks to slim down, fast…</p><p><strong>1. Take a cold shower</strong></p><p>“Short sharp exposure to cold water has been shown to increase the metabolic rate,” explains Dr Deborah Lee of Dr Fox Online Pharmacy (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">www.doctorfox.co.uk</a>).</p><p>“Do this slowly, perhaps ending your shower every day with say 10 seconds on cold, and gradually build this up to two to three minutes, two or three times a week.”</p><p><strong>2. Get supplement savvy</strong></p><p>Certain supplements can help with weight loss and metabolism. Dr Lee recommends taking a chromium supplement containing 1,000μg (micrograms) per day, as it “may help reduce appetite and food cravings”.</p><p>“In one 2008 double blind study, 42 overweight adult women were randomly assigned to take either chromium 1,000μg per day for eight weeks, or a placebo.&nbsp;</p><p>“After eight weeks, the chromium group was found to have a significant reduction in food intake, hunger, and fat cravings, and showed a tendency to a reduction in body weight.”</p><p>She adds that “other studies have shown chromium may be an adjunct to weight loss”.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3. Eat within set hours</strong></p><p>If you’re a grazer, this one's for you.&nbsp;</p><p>“Setting an ‘eating window’ means you’ll avoid that period of the evening where it’s tempting to pick at food for hours on end.</p><p>“Try only eating between the hours of 9am and 7pm at night,” says personal trainer Lucy Gornall.</p><p>You could even set this as an alarm on your phone to remind you that your eating time is over for the day.</p><p><strong>4. Keep a healthy house</strong></p><p>January is the perfect time to ditch the unhealthy foods from kitchen cupboards and drawers. Food banks are a good place to drop unwanted - but sealed and in-date - food off to, rather than wasting it.</p><p>Instead of sugary, calorific foods, Joanna Dase, fitness expert at Curves Gym (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">www.curves.eu/en/</a>) recommends stocking the kitchen with healthy snacks so you give yourself the best chance of successful weight loss.</p><p>Can’t resist a snack?</p><p>“Healthy snacks include carrots with hummus, apple slices with peanut butter, a small handful of nuts, a hard-boiled egg with some spinach leaves, or a handful of plain popcorn.”</p><p><strong>5. Scrap booze</strong></p><p>It’s just for one month, and not only will you save up to around 4,000 calories across the four weeks, but your liver, digestion, skin, hair, mood and a multitude of other things, will also benefit.</p><p>Joanna explains that a single glass of wine contains around 133 calories, equivalent to three Jaffa Cakes, whilst a pint of beer contains just under the same amount of calories found in a Mars Bar.</p><p><strong>6. Don’t snack on carbs alone</strong></p><p>Claire Snowdon-Darling, founder of kinesiology clinic, Balanced Wellness explains that whenever we eat carbs, such as bread, pasta or rice, our blood sugars spike and in response, we produce the hormone insulin.</p><p>“Insulin helps the body to lower blood sugar but it also signals to the body to store fat.</p><p>“As our blood sugars drop in response to the insulin, we produce the stress hormone cortisol.&nbsp;</p><p>“When we produce cortisol a load of sugar gets dumped into our muscles so we can be ready for ‘fight or flight’, or in this case to go and ‘find more food’.&nbsp;</p><p>“That sugar then also triggers an insulin response, and we end up in a blood sugar roller coaster that stops us losing weight,” says Claire.</p><p>Help stop this from happening by eating fat alongside carbs.&nbsp;</p><p>Complement fruit with a handful of nuts, for example, or have a slice of bread topped with peanut butter.</p><p><strong>7. Trick your mind</strong></p><p>Our minds are more powerful than we think, but Emily Hall, weight loss coach and hypnotherapist at Fresh Forward (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fresh-forward.co.uk</a>), has a few simple cheats up her sleeve.&nbsp;</p><p>“Use smaller plates so you don’t overload with food, drink fizzy water served in a wine glass so you feel like you’re still ‘drinking’ and put chocolates out of sight because when food is in view, you’ll automatically eat more.”</p><p><strong>8. Swap pudding for a starter</strong></p><p>Off out to eat? Ditch the dessert but keep the first course as this could save up to 800 calories, reveals Dr Naresh Kanumilli, medical director at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Liva Healthcare</a>.</p><p>“Soup is often a good choice as it fills you up.&nbsp;</p><p>“If you feel left out while everyone else is eating a pudding, you could have a coffee during that course instead.</p><p>Drink fizzy water served in a wine glass so you feel like you’re still ‘drinking’</p><span class=quote-credit>Emily Hall</span><p><strong>9. Eat often</strong></p><p>Elliott Upton, personal trainer at Ultimate Performance (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ultimateperformance.com</a>), says that eating every “two to four hours is crucial”.</p><p>“The more regularly you eat, the better you can control your appetite.”</p><p>Regular eating means splitting up your meals and calorie intake relatively evenly across the day.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Elliott adds:<strong> </strong>“It’s not really about how many calories you consume per meal, but the quality of those calories and the overall amount of calories you consume per day.”</p><p>He recommends tracking your meals and calorie count throughout the day but adds that “if you start to obsess or overthink about hitting a certain amount of calories per meal, it can lead to unnecessary anxiety”, so stop immediately if you feel this happening.</p><p><strong>10. Pack in protein&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“Protein is really satiating,” says Elliott.</p><p>“This means it will help you feel full for a lot longer, so you don’t get hungry between meals, fall off the wagon and snack on calorie-laden junk foods that will dent your weight loss efforts.”&nbsp;</p><p>Men should aim to eat between 30 to 50g of protein per meal whilst women should aim to eat between 20 to 30g of protein per meal.&nbsp;</p><p>For perspective, 100g of chicken contains around 30g of protein whilst one egg contains around 6g.</p><p><strong>11. Walk for 10 minutes a day</strong></p><p>Just adding an extra 10 to 12 minutes of walking each day could burn an extra 100 calories, says Ryan Hodgson, Health and Happiness Coach (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hodgsonhealth.com</a>)</p><p>“Taking the stairs over lifts as part of your lifestyle can also burn up to 250 calories a week, which may not seem like a lot, but doing this consistently certainly pays off for total calories burnt.”</p><p><strong>12. Avoid caffeine after 12noon</strong></p><p>Swap your afternoon coffee hit for the decaf version instead. Why?&nbsp;</p><p>Caffeine has a six hour ​half-life, says James Griffiths, Owner of Wild Training (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">www.wildtraining.co.uk</a>), “meaning if you have caffeine after midday you aren’t going to sleep properly”.&nbsp;</p><p>A lack of sleep can lead to a lack of energy, which can mean you start reaching for sugary foods to perk you up.</p><p>January is the perfect month to rack up the bedtime hours, so set yourself a sleep schedule and stick to it as rigidly as you can.</p><p><strong>13. Watch your portions&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Michael Brigo, Body Transformation Coach (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">www.brigopt.com</a>) explains that all you need is your hand to ensure the correct portion and balance of food at every meal.&nbsp;</p><p>Aim to eat a cupped hand portion of carbohydrates (such as pasta, and grains), a palm size portion of protein (such as fish, chicken, or tofu), a thumb size portion of fat (such as olive oil and nut butter) and a fist size portion of vegetables.</p><p>“This strategy means you don’t need to weigh food, count calories, or keep track of everything.&nbsp;</p><p>“Your hand is proportionate to your body; its size never changes and it is always with you, making it the perfect tool for measuring.”</p><p>When you’re inundated with lots of different tastes, you want to eat more</p><span class=quote-credit>Emily Hall</span><p><strong>14. Munch on sweet potatoes&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The white potatoes’ cousin, the sweet variety are a great weight loss tool and an essential item to pop into your shopping trolley.&nbsp;</p><p>Elliott explains that sweet potatoes have a low Glycemic Index (GI), especially when steamed or boiled.&nbsp;</p><p>“The glycemic index helps measure the impact of a certain food on blood sugar levels.”</p><p>Low GI foods are helpful at keeping you fuller for longer, controlling appetite and helping avoid those calorific sweet cravings.&nbsp;</p><p>Sweet potatoes also contain vitamin A - essential for normal vision, bone growth and healthy skin, as well as Vitamin C, which can help protect our immune systems and avoid winter coughs and colds.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>15. Go veggie (but only three times a week!)</strong></p><p>We aren’t telling you to give up meat, but Emily says that going vegetarian three or four times a week can save on calories.&nbsp;</p><p>“Plus, vegetables are lower in fat and calories and contain a lot of water, so they can leave you feeling fuller.</p><p>“If you do choose meat, go for the lower fat options such as chicken or turkey rather than sausage meats or other meats which can be higher in fat and salt.”</p><p><strong>16. Go plain</strong></p><p>“Limit the amount of flavours you have,” recommends Emily.</p><p>“When you’re inundated with lots of different tastes, you want to eat more.&nbsp;</p><p>“Think about it, if you have one meal that contains meat and two veg and one that’s a range of tapas dishes, which one will you eat more of?”</p><p>It’s also worth keeping in mind that this is short term, and more flavours can be re-introduced in time.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>17. Slow it down&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It takes our body about 20 minutes to register fullness, from the moment we start eating.&nbsp;</p><p>So, the faster you eat, the more you’ll consume.&nbsp;</p><p>When was the last time you spent 20 minutes on a meal?&nbsp;</p><p>Focus on chewing food until it’s completely broken down in your mouth, and place cutlery down between each mouthful.</p><p>Plus, opting for crunchier foods can also help with the pace of eating; crunchier foods take longer to chew, so you’ll eat less.</p><p><strong>18. Chew gum</strong></p><p>Snacking throughout the day is often a sign of boredom rather than hunger, so keeping your mouth busy can help distract the mind.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>“Pop a piece of sugar-free gum in your mouth so the chewing action is mimicked,” says Lucy.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000278254244.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>8 tips to lose weight WITHOUT fad diets or sweaty gym sessions</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57x56YpayYZIF1fo9wcGlnmKTEbsDOZqOoq5Virm6%2F06ilnmWZo3qiecyopa2gXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-to-lose-a-stone-in-a-month.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-to-lose-a-stone-in-a-month.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-to-lose-a-stone-in-a-month.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-to-lose-a-stone-in-a-month.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-to-lose-a-stone-in-a-month.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-to-lose-a-stone-in-a-month.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./billie-piper-reveals-stunning-secret-sister-and-she-looks-almost-identical-to-the-star.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./billie-piper-reveals-stunning-secret-sister-and-she-looks-almost-identical-to-the-star.html>Billie Piper reveals stunning 'secret' sister and she looks almost identical to the star</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-daniel-murphy-dating.html>Who is Daniel Murphy Dating Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-is-daniel-murphy-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
