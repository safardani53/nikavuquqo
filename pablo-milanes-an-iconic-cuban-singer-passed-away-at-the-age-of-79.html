While his officials acknowledged his passing, they did not disclose the cause of death. Milanes was being treated for blood cancer, although it is uncertain if the ailment was the cause of his death.&nbsp;Cuban Prime Minister Manuel Marrero Cruz paid homage to him on social media, mourning his death, stating,</p><p>“The culture of Cuba is in grief at Pablo Milanes’ death.”</p><p>Milanes is credited as co-founding the Cuban nueva trova with Silvio Rodriguez and Noel Nicola. He released a number of albums and songs, including Yolanda, Yo Me Quedo, Amo Esta Isla, and others.</p><h2>Twitter users pay homage to the late singer.</h2><p>Pablo Milanes has recently become a household name in the music world due to his faultless songs. When the news of his death surfaced, Twitter was inundated with tributes:</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Cuban musician Pablo Milanés has passed away.

He was hospitalized earlier this month, and as a result, he canceled his gigs.&nbsp;In June 2014, the singer experienced renal failure and was sent to the University Hospital Complex of La Coruna. He had a kidney transplant from his wife Nancy Perez, who donated the organ.&nbsp;At the time, sources said Milanes was healing well after the procedure alongside Perez. Pablo was reportedly said to have had 22 operations over the course of his life owing to persistent necrosis in the head of the femur, which caused him tremendous discomfort.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Pablo-Milanes-1.jpg alt="Pablo Milanes" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He had another operation in March 2012 when physicians discovered an umbilical hernia that may have led to peritonitis. Aside from these health issues, there have been several speculations about his health throughout the years.</p><h2>Pablo Milanes released almost 40 albums over his career.</h2><p>Pablo Milanes, born on February 24, 1943, migrated to Havana with his family in 1950. He enrolled at the Conservatorio Municipal de La Habana and made his debut in 1956. He started playing in bohemian musical circles at the age of 15.&nbsp;Milanes supported the Cuban Revolution and was detained in the UMAP agricultural forced labor camp in Camaguey in 1965. He fled in 1967, resulting in his incarceration at La Cabana, and he was only liberated when the prison camp was closed.</p><p>In 1969, he joined the Grupo de Experimentation Sonora, a group of young musicians, the majority of whom went on to form the nueva trova. Milanes worked with various singers from Cuba, Latin America, and Spain before releasing his debut album of original songs in 1976.&nbsp;Milanes was regarded as one of the rare vocalists who adhered to the traditional roots of Cuban music while also being receptive to musical influences from other modern traditions such as Brazilian music and blues. He wrote poetry for Cuban poets such as Jose Marti and Nicolas Guillen and was inspired by artists such as Lorenzo Hierrezuelo, Benny More, Maria Teresa Vera, Lucho Gatica, Johann Sebastian Bach, and others.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Pablo-Milanes-2.jpg alt="Pablo Milanes" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He attacked various parts of the Cuban administration after relocating to Spain.
