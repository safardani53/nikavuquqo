They met during a football game where she was a cheerleader. The couple encountered each other while both were in the Bay Area.</p><p>At first, both were on the opposite teams, so there was a rivalry between them. But, slowly, they decided to share a good bond and started dating.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/wedding-picture.jpg><p>Shortly after the couple started dating, a St. Patrick’s Day Festival in San Jose, California, was their first date location.&nbsp;</p><p>Alex’s close friend David Edward who died by suicide in 2008, had played an essential role in building the couple’s relationship. He was the best friend to Elizabeth also, and his death affected both.</p><p>During the grieving time, their bond became more vital, and in the following year, the couple tied the knot. Now, they have been together for over a decade, but love is still fresh.&nbsp;</p><h2>Elizabeth Barry: Children with Alex Smith</h2><p>Elizabeth and Alex tied the knot on February 21, 2009, at San Francisco’s Palace Hotel. But because of her husband’s work, she had to move to several places.</p><p>The two are now blessed with two sons and one daughter. They welcomed the firstborn son named Hudson on May 11, 2011.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smith-family.jpg><p>After giving birth to the first child, Elizabeth quit her cheerleading career.</p><p>On March 20, 2013, the family extended with the arrival of the second son, Hayes. Finally, a baby girl came to the family on February 4, 2016, named Sloane Kenzington Smith.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>12 Best NFL Lineman of all Time >></a></strong></p><h3>How did Elizabeth handle her husband Alex’s brutal injury?</h3><p>In 2018, Alex faced horrific injuries. During a game against Houston Texans, his right leg snapped as a bone penetrated the skin. He suffered several fractures, and due to several complications, Alex developed sepsis, a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body is fighting an infection.</p><p>The Doctors gave him options to either amputate the leg or salvage. Alex chose to try and salvage the portion, and fortunately, the infection was gone after several surgeries.</p><p>When Alex was at rest because of his leg injury and sepsis, he was like the fourth child to the family. Elizabeth did a commendable job by taking care of her husband, who was primarily incoherent due to the medication.</p><p>Finally, Alex returned to his game field in August 2020 with the consultant of the doctor.</p><p>But every time Elizabeth Barry saw Alex in the field, she used to feel nauseous. She felt extremely nervous.&nbsp;</p><h2>Who is Alex Smith?</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Alex Smith</a> started his football journey by playing with the college football team at Utah. He was named All-American and led the team to win in the 2005 Fiesta Bowl.</p><p>The San Francisco 49ers picked Smith in the 2005 NFL Draft because of his successful college career in football.</p><p>Earlier in his career, Alex had to deal with several injuries, but in 2011 he played an essential role in the team and led his team to victory in the NFC West division title. The San Francisco 49ers had not won the title since 2002, so it was a historic moment for the team.&nbsp;</p><p>Alex gained three Pro Bowl selections during his stay in City Chiefs, and, in 2017, he led the team in passer rating.</p><p>In 2018, Alex was traded to Washington Football Team. Unfortunately, his first season in Washington was unlucky for him. He came across a life-threatening injury in his right leg. The damage was so severe that many assumed he would be unable to play again.</p><p>But in 2020, he returned and led his team Washington to win an NFC East division title.</p><h3>Retirement</h3><p>After spending sixteen years in a league, Alex retired from the NFL on April 19, 2021. He announced retirement news through Instagram and said now he wants to spend more time with his family.</p><h3>Elizabeth and Alex’s Active Participation in Service Works</h3><p>Both Elizabeth and Alex are involved in Philanthropy. The couple has been engaged in various organizations for the people in need. One of the organizations is Hope House.</p><p>They have been raising voices and helping the victims of domestic violence. Hope House is a Kansas City-based organization working to break the cycle of domestic violence and providing support services to educate and empower the victims.</p><p></p><p>Besides that, the couple runs their foundation called The Alex Smith Foundation. The main motive behind the foundation is to help society. It was established in 2007 and had scholarships programs for the foster teenager’s college fees.</p><p>The foundation is spending more than ninety percent of its fund on scholarships, and the Smith couple personally gave a large sum to the charity.</p><p>Barry is also an active member of her husband’s foundation.</p><h2>Elizabeth Barry: Net Worth</h2><p>The current profession of Elizabeth is not disclosed. So, it is difficult to say about her net worth. But when she was working as a cheerleader, she might have earned a good amount of money.</p><p>Nowadays, Elizabeth Barry is busy raising her kids. And, currently, she is enjoying her husband’s net worth. But, because of Elizabeth’s mental support, Alex continued his profession for more than a decade.</p><p>Alex has an impressive net worth of approximately $55 million, where most of his wealth came from his professional NFL career.</p><h2>Elizabeth Barry: Social Media Presence</h2><p>Elizabeth is quite active on<a href=#> Instagram</a> and has nearly 59.1k followers.</p><p>While Alex was recovering from his injury, Elizabeth often posted her husband’s exhausting journey with uplifting updates and pictures on social media.</p><p>On special occasions, Elizabeth doesn’t restrain herself from writing a heartful message for her beloved once. For example, she made an appreciation post on her tenth marriage anniversary with Alex and explained her beautiful journey over the years.</p><p>She is also seen sharing adorable pictures for her children.
