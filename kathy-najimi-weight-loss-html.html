Read the full exclusive article to get the answer.&nbsp;</p><h2>How did Kathy Najimy lose so much weight??</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Well, instead of choosing rigorous gym routines, the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="follow noopener">Hocus Pocus</a> star chose the path of Zumba in 2012, an&nbsp;interval workout that involves high and low-intensity dance moves. She preferred to try it after knowing from somewhere that an individual could shed a couple of pounds after practicing certain dance steps.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Before trying Zumba, Najimy had been so exhausted by different workout regimes and diet plans that she was pondering about getting surgery. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The year, Najimy's dedication to practicing Zumba also earned the "Zumba Fitness Ambassador Award." She later said in an interview that she had never imagined being the face of Zumba or believed likewise while growing up. She also credits the dancing form for its positive effects on both physical and mental health outcomes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"Zumba is a fantastic, pressure-free workout; people of all shapes, sizes and fitness levels are encouraged to give it a try. It is simple to assemble, and once assembled, it will function well. It surely will," she said.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>And some reports have suggested that she switched to light diet plans, preferring vegetables over meat. However, Najimy has never spoken about her weight loss, let alone about having a specific diet plan.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, even Zumba regimes indeed need one to follow a diet plan for better results, usually by reducing carbohydrates and balancing food instantly through fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins such as meat.</p><p>In that case, we know that Najimy is not a vegan or vegetarian, but she "respects" the cause.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Dolls,Just 2 clarify,altho i lov veganfood options i'm cooking vegetarian (not vegan) n hnor of my veggie dauter on RvsGuy & playng 4 <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@peta</a> — Kathy Najimy (@kathynajimy) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">January 8, 2013</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@MrsRheinfeldt</a> no, i'm not a vegan.but i respect &suport it.playng 4 <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@peta</a> cookng only vegetrian on the foodtv show n honr o daughtr who is. — Kathy Najimy (@kathynajimy) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">January 8, 2013</a></p><h2>Zumba: the ultimate Secret to Najimy's weight loss</h2><p>Najimy&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">admitted</a>&nbsp;to trying out many different health regimes to lose weight before finding the one that worked for her. She tried everything from&nbsp;soup fasts and&nbsp;watermelon diets to spas.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>However, when she was introduced to Zumba, she knew she had found her match. Not only did the fitness program help her to shed some pounds, but it also helped to reduce&nbsp;pain in her knees and lower back.</p><p></p><p><strong>Kathy Najimy Before and After her Weight loss.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">U.S. Weekly</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Thanks to her positive outlook on the fitness program, the&nbsp;American actress was also awarded the&nbsp;'Zumba Fitness Ambassador Award' in 2012. She kept her humor intact while receiving the award,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">addressing</a>&nbsp;that some time ago, it would've been unimaginable for a person like her to be looked up to as a fitness advocate. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Who would have ever thought I’d be the face or the body or the person who would advocate any kind of fitness?</p><p>Ever since&nbsp;losing 50 pounds and keeping it off with the help of Zumba, Najimy has advocated the benefits of the Latin-inspired dance aerobics workout, focusing mainly on how relaxed it feels compared to other heavy exercise routines.&nbsp;</p><p>Zumba is a great, no-pressure workout...everybody is welcome, all sizes.&nbsp;</p><p>The actor also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shared</a> that Zumba didn't just help her physically, but it also helped improve her mental well-being. She said, "I'm not afraid—will I fit into that ride? Will I fit into the seat on the plane?"&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"I have more confidence to say yes to jobs. I don't have to worry about finding a costume that will fit me. That part of it is somewhat relieved," she added.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>She is much more than just an actor</h2><p>Not only is Najimy famous for her professional contributions, but the actor is also known for being an activist for many causes. The Sister Act star has been advocating about issues related to the rights of the LGBTIQ+ community since the young age of 18.&nbsp;</p><p>The comedian,&nbsp;who&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">won</a>&nbsp;the NY lily award for 'Activist of the year' in 2016,&nbsp;is keen on voicing her thoughts about social issues like body positivity, AIDS awareness, animal rights, and women's rights. In an interview with TV Guide, the actor confessed to being a political person. However, she admitted that being an actor only meant more people could hear her voice. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Additionally, she talked about how she did not believe that if you were an activist before you were an actor, your journey should not stop once you got into acting. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>A lot of people think that actors should just shut up and act — and I respect that point of view if it is an actor who doesn't have anything to contribute. But if you were a political person before, and you just happened into a movie, to stop being a political person makes no sense.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Najimy is married and has a daughter.</h2><p>Unlike many people in Hollywood, Najimy&nbsp;has been very lucky, both in love and the professional arena. The&nbsp;Hocus Pocus star "quietly" married comedian and musician Dan Finnerty in 1995, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Philadelphia Inquirer.</a>&nbsp;Together, the pair has&nbsp;a daughter who shares the same first name as her maternal grandmother,&nbsp;Samia.</p><p>Like her father, who is the frontman&nbsp;of the comic rock group Damn Band, Samia is also the vocalist for her band and has recently debuted in the music industry with her album Baby. In addition, her&nbsp;Instagram account shows she is just as involved in activism as her mother.&nbsp;</p><h2>What ethnicity is Kathy Najimy?</h2><p>Born on February 6, 1957, to a Lebanese mother, Samia, and a postal worker father, Fred, Najimy is a Lebanese American with mixed ethnicity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6CutbTYZqWaopmitm7DxKKeoaxdoby0v42hq6ak</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkathy-najimi-weight-loss-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkathy-najimi-weight-loss-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkathy-najimi-weight-loss-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkathy-najimi-weight-loss-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkathy-najimi-weight-loss-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkathy-najimi-weight-loss-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jada-will-smiths-most-talked-about-moments-celebs-react.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jada-will-smiths-most-talked-about-moments-celebs-react.html>Jada, Will Smith's Most Talked About Moments: Celebs React</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./6ffvcdoled6wl7gjgthurjqqjcb0rfcv.html>Watch Bob the Builder (Classic) Season 1 Episode 6: Wendy's Busy Day</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./6ffvcdoled6wl7gjgthurjqqjcb0rfcv.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
