"But then it kept on following me, and that's when it attacked me."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The incident happened around 4:45 p.m. while Dylan was walking with a friend along a neighborhood creek, just a few blocks away from her Livingston home, WABC and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>WCBS-TV</a> reported.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The little girl said she noticed the fox behind her, and despite not thinking it was real at first, she began to run away.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I ran, just in case, and then it followed me so then I knew it wasn't a dream," she explained to WCBS-TV. "I fell down when I was running away and then it started biting me on my legs."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to the outlet, Dylan sustained 19 bites on her legs and feet before neighbor Matt Nichter, who was playing basketball with some friends at the time of the incident, came to her rescue.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I sprinted at it and approached it [with my arms spread out] to show I was much bigger, and then I just chased the fox to make sure it left," he explained to WCBS-TV. "I didn't have a lot of fear because I knew I had a lot better chance than this 8-year-old girl."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was holding a ball in my hand, so I used that as a bit of a distraction," he added to WABC. "The little girl ran away, and she was able to get to safety, I guess. I carried her up into the front of the house and calmed her down a little bit. She was a little bit torn up about it, obviously."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After a neighbor called Dylan's mom, Stacey Dratch, the little girl was taken to St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, where she was treated for her injuries, WABC reported. By Thursday, she was home recovering with her wounds bandaged.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Recalling how she responded to the terrifying incident, Stacey said she had to remain calm for her daughter.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"[You have to] try not to show your kid that you're having a breakdown," she told WABC. "Go into protect mode, and she was okay."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>RELATED VIDEO: Bear Mauls and Kills Man After Trying to Take Selfie with Injured Animal</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Both Dylan and her mother also said they feel immense gratitude toward Nichter for jumping into action and scaring the fox away.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"[He's] a lifesaver," Dylan shared with WABC, with her mom adding, "He is a godsend, very grateful. Just grateful she's okay."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though fox and coyote sightings are reportedly common in the New Jersey area, Livingston Police Chief Gary Marshuetz said attacks are "extremely rare." He urged residents to be cautious while outdoors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This is the first time in 31 years that we've had a fox attack a human," Marshuetz said in a press conference, according to WABC. "So it is extremely rare, but again, you always want to make noise, be mindful of the fact... they have den or home areas, and they do have pups in the spring."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Anytime you see an animal behaving oddly, that you just move away from it and leave it be and call us and we'll take care of it," Livingston Police Captain Tom Smith added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5iquqK6jKKlrZ2imsC1e5dmsJ6ZomK8rbCMoKCrpF2WwbWtwqScnWWSrnqnu9dmpZ6ZomK7q3nHqKSeZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f8-year-old-girl-attacked-by-fox-near-nj-home.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f8-year-old-girl-attacked-by-fox-near-nj-home.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f8-year-old-girl-attacked-by-fox-near-nj-home.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f8-year-old-girl-attacked-by-fox-near-nj-home.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f8-year-old-girl-attacked-by-fox-near-nj-home.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f8-year-old-girl-attacked-by-fox-near-nj-home.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./busta-rhymes-lost-100-lbs-after-breathing-scare-during-intimate-act.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./busta-rhymes-lost-100-lbs-after-breathing-scare-during-intimate-act.html>Busta Rhymes Lost 100 Lbs After Breathing Scare During 'Intimate' Act</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
