The boxes have changed and I think people are confused about what goes in each box, with food wrappers or meal boxes, are they plastic or in cardboard.</p><p>''If the stickers were just put on the wrong item that might be able to help more, or if they took the rest of the recycling and left the one wrong item then that would make more sense and people would learn.</p><p>''Especially at this time of year after Christmas people have had lots of cans and bottles that they need to recycle and it's not a time when you want your box to be overflowing, and come outside to see an oops sticker on them.</p><p>"The stickers are really riling people up, and winding them up, they really are getting under peoples skin."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/nintchdbpict000292427911.jpg><p>He added: ''I've received a number of calls regarding boxes being left untouched by the binmen, usually with just an 'oops' sticker left on the box.</p><p>"Many people go to great lengths to follow the instructions in good faith and yet the whole box is left untouched, because presumably one or two items, unbeknown to them are in the wrong coloured box.</p><p>"For the life of me I can't understand why the recycling contractors don't take the correct items to recycle and leave the incorrect items in the box with a small sticker on those items noting why they were left.</p><p>"Many people believe the items are dropping out of the compartments on the van as the contractors are going along.</p><p>"Whichever way this is happening, its not pleasant and seems to be a growing problem of litter blighting the local environment.</p><p>"Surely some common sense needs to be applied to collections as the situation as it stands is infuriating many ratepayers who are trying their best to recycle and help the county achieve its recycling targets."</p><p>The Council introduced three-weekly refuse collections last October, hailing a 15% increase in the amount of recycled material in November 2016 compared to the previous year.</p><p>Under the current system residents have to put grass and hedge cuttings in a green bin, raw and uncooked food in a ''food waste bins,'' mixed paper and envelopes in a red box, plastic tubs, empty food tins and aerosols and clean foil in a blue box and glass bottles and cardboard in an orange box.</p><p>It said it asked waste collection firm Biffa, to be ''lenient'' with householders if they found wrong items in wrong boxes.</p><p>But a spokesman said:"Our waste management team will look into concerns raised by Cllr Jones and if improvements or changes are needed we'll work with our contractor to ensure these are carried out."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/nintchdbpict000292428021.jpg><p>Anglesey's Chief Waste Management Officer, Meirion Edwards said: "Early figures show large increases in recycling. We've also received a significant numbers of requests for blue and red boxes and food waste bins as people begin to recycle items that can be collected every week in a recycling box, rather than every three weeks in their black bin."</p><p>He added, "Residents have got to grips with the new recycling system very quickly and I would like to thank them for their patience and understanding during the initial roll out of the new collection service to over 34,000 homes across the Island.</p><p>''There have been teething problems, as you'd expect with the launch of any complex new service, but I would urge residents to continue to bear with us.</p><p>"We'll be encouraging residents to use the information pack provided and to put the recycling boxes out again the following week with the correct items in them.</p><p>''We're also encouraging residents to rinse out items and squash them to get more into their boxes, particularly with plastic drink bottles that can be squashed down very small, making much more room in their blue recycling box."</p><p><strong>We pay for your stories!
