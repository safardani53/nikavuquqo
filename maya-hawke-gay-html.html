Hence, the speculations demand inquiries about her past relationships and boyfriend.</p><p>But before digging up that information to find the truth, one has to understand how the rumors of her being gay started.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Maya Hawke's Gay Rumors Started from&nbsp;'Stranger Things'</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Hawke's portrayal of Robin on the Netflix series&nbsp;Stranger Things&nbsp;made the fans truly believe that Hawke's sexuality was&nbsp;lesbian in real life. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>To those unfamiliar with the series, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Robin</a> debuted in the third season when the show was already crashing Netflix's streaming server. Most fans immediately&nbsp;liked her character's complexity and depth, and they loved when she came out as gay.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Hawke was admittedly invested in playing Robin as she expected viewers to empathize with her character. And in the 2019 red carpet event, Hawke told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Variety</a>&nbsp;that&nbsp;Robin had the potential to influence people.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>"If I can hope for anything it's that maybe some people fell in love with Robin, and that helped them fall in love with girls who love girls and boys who love boys," she noted. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Strangely, the show's writers had not initially determined Robin's emerging sexuality. But, according to Hawke, during the production of season three, the Duffer brothers, <a href=# rel=follow>Shawn Levy</a>, and herself collectively discussed and decided to portray Robin as a gay character.&nbsp;</p><p>"Throughout filming, we started to feel like she and [Steve] shouldn't get together, and that she's gay. Even when I go back and watch earlier episodes, it just seems like the most obvious decision ever," she explained.&nbsp;</p><p>She shared: "It wasn't really until we were shooting episode four and five, I think, that we made the final decision. It was kind of a collaborative conversation, and I'm really, really happy with the way that it went." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=image-align-center></p><p><strong>Maya Hawke drew on Robin's shoes to get into character.&nbsp;</strong>(Photo: Netflix/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Later, Netflix reported that even the costume designer was dedicated to letting Hawke explore Robin's sexuality. Hawke was allowed to draw on Robin's red converse, where she drew Robin's essence with words like "god likes you, of course."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p><strong>A look into Robin - the lesbian character</strong></p><p>Hawke's character Robin was introduced in season three of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Stranger Things</a> as a co-worker and former classmate of Steve Harrington. Steve and Robin develop a bond of best friends out of their similar interests.</p><p>It is through Steve Robin'sgets connected with other characters in the show and the major Russian plot.&nbsp;</p><p>Since Robin&nbsp;is Steve's best friend and an important ally of his against supernatural forces, she is used to his complex love life. They are so close enough that their bond relies on honest and shared memories. Even in the final scene of the episode where Steve makes a move on Robin, she openly comes out as a lesbian and talks about the high school girl named Tammy Thompson, who used to like Steve. Then, she also explains that her likeliness towards Thompson was why she hated him in high school while she was equally fascinated by him.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>Later,&nbsp;Robin decides to help survivors of the massive earthquake that destroyed a part of Hawkins and&nbsp;meets her crush, Vickie, who recently broke up with her boyfriend. Robin gets to know Vickie's story, and they start to bond. But it looks like fate has another planâ€”they see the particles from Upside Down starts to drop on Hawkins.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2>Is Maya Hawke Gay?</h2><p>After playing Robin, fans questioned Hawke's real-life sexuality and speculated is she was gay. And it only intensified after she starred&nbsp;in a music video for Therese, a song from her album&nbsp;Moss.&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="follow noopener">Pride</a>&nbsp;reported that her video enunciated Hawke's explicitly queer and languid crooning with scenes of&nbsp;group orgy interrupted by police. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>During the video's press release, Hawke explained that her song denied&nbsp;the systematic misunderstanding and opined humans were created to be free. She highlighted she was reclaiming a new belief in sexuality and discarding the societal image of sex or gender.&nbsp;</p><p>"We are all bombarded with negative and doctored images of bodies all the time, whether we want to be or not," she poetically continued&nbsp;during the film's screening.&nbsp;</p><p>She conceded the idea of sexuality taught to her by society, where "[it] seems to want us all to hate ourselves and fear others," was conventional. But after understanding her adult self, she said she searched for a meaningful connection, not a partnership with the other sex.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>While Hawke does not recognize herself as gay, her statements imply she was more focused on the person than&nbsp;their sexuality. And it is not sure if she has found that person yet.&nbsp;</p><p>The last time her dating life made headlines was when she was spotted with <a href=# rel=follow>her reported boyfriend</a>, Spender Barnett, on&nbsp;Valentine's Day in 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>Before Barnett, she was&nbsp;linked with <a href=# rel=follow>Tom Sturridge</a>. They were reported to have dated for more than a year until 2021.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><h2>Hawke hopes her portrayal helps the LGBTIQ+ community</h2><p>Hawke, who appeared in the 2022 Netflix film <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Do Revenge</a> as a queer character&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Eleanor</a>, is optimistic that her gay portrayals help the "boys" and "girls" explore their sexuality.&nbsp;</p><p>"If I can hope for anything, it's that maybe some people fell in love with Robin, and that helped them fall in love with girls who love girls and boys who love boys," she told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Variety</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKWRrq5utMCwop5ll5bGb7TTpqM%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmaya-hawke-gay-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmaya-hawke-gay-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmaya-hawke-gay-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmaya-hawke-gay-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmaya-hawke-gay-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmaya-hawke-gay-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./enzo-frieser.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./enzo-frieser.html>Enzo Frieser- Net Worth, Bio, Age, Height, Girlfriend, Nationality, Facts</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-john-m-jackson-dating.html>Who is John M.
