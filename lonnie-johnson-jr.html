So there is something negative going around the corner.</p><p>According to Lonnie, ” It’s a rough city to grow up in .” He often saw a lot of deaths, a lot of shootings, his parents visiting the jail.</p><p>Henceforth, those incidents turned him to be of those who dreamed of doing something hilarious for his hometown in a positive manner and giving it back to his community.</p><p>All Loonie wanted was, as a kid, to remove all the stains of blood, sins, and brutality from the place where he hailed.</p><h3>Struggles as a kid</h3><p>According to his mother, Nora, they had their own share of struggles. When Loonie was in high school, his family moved into his grandmother’s two-bedroom home for several months as their house was put on the market without letting them know.</p><p>At least seventeen members had to live in the same room.</p><p>Nora worked two jobs as a bus driver and one as a track coach to survive her and families livelihood.
