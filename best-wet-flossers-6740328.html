It clocked perfect scores for ease of use and effectiveness, losing only half a point for settings. (It has only three modes â€” not a terribly low amount, but not outstanding.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We got every bit of gunk out of our teeth with this all-around great flosser. We also liked how the curved handle felt in our hand, noting that it's easy to hold, direct the flow of water, and switch between the normal, soft, and pulse modes. We were particularly fond of the pulse setting, which did an excellent job of flushing out crumbs from between the teeth. The water reservoir was easy to fill as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Thanks to a rechargeable lithium-ion battery, the Aqua Flosser is conveniently cordless and lasts for weeks between charges.

Considering the very reasonable price tag and the fact that it comes with four replacement tips, we gave this product a perfect score for overall value. With that said, we'd recommend it to pretty much anyone in the market for a water flosser.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Power Source:</strong> Rechargeable battery | <strong>Features:</strong> 3 modes, 4 tip replacements, 2-minute timer, 360-degree rotary nozzle | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 10 x 3 x 0.5 inches | <strong>Reservoir Capacity: </strong>150 milliliters</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Vicky Wasik</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-h2ofloss-water-flosser-portable-dental-oral-irrigator></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>H2ofloss Water Flosser</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="H2ofloss Water Flosser Portable Dental Oral Irrigator" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/-rodddMioRQfhLhfVvzMTCLyOY0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/h2ofloss-water-flosser-portable-dental-oral-irrigator-8a5d52c1339741da885a67caf98311a5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>It has a cordless design.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It comes with five modes and six heads.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It includes a rechargeable battery.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>This model has a large reservoir.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=-1><p>The instruction manual isnâ€™t very thorough.</p></li><li readability=0><p>When using on high-pressure mode, this model splashes water.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">H2ofloss makes a great budget pick. The brand's Cordless Oral Irrigator earned perfect scores for ease of use, effectiveness, and overall value. Though we appreciate that it has five modes, we knocked off half a point for settings since the higher speeds were a little too strong, making it harder to control and splashing water everywhere. That said, the softer modes were not only plenty effective but also comfortable and manageable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While the instruction manual wasn't very thorough, we found the product design intuitive and user-friendly. This cordless wet flosser has a rechargeable battery and a generously sized 300-milliliter water reservoir. It comes with six heads, including two jet tips, a tongue cleaner, a periodontal tip (to flush out the gums), and an orthodontic tip (for braces and retainers).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Based on the ample features and high-end functionality, we were surprised by the wallet-friendly price point.

The instructions are clear, and the setup is simple â€” all you do is plug it in and fill it with water. We tried it out after eating a plate of nachos and were left feeling completely clean. It's easy to toggle between the 10 intensity modes, and the quad-stream tip delivers four streams of water for a more thorough whole-mouth cleaning.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This water flosser has a large 550-milliliter (18.6-ounce) lidded reservoir, so you won't have to refill it mid-session. It isn't cordless, so you won't have to worry about recharging it, though it's not very travel-friendly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The flosser itself is compact and lightweight. And while the reservoir dock will take up some counter space, we appreciate that the handle attaches magnetically to the base. The price is steep, but we think it's worth it based on the settings and effectiveness.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Power Source:</strong> Corded electric | <strong>Features:</strong> 2 modes, 10 intensities, quad-stream tip, magnetic dock | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 10 x 1.5 inches | <strong>Reservoir Capacity: </strong>550 milliliters</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-2 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=3333 data-sizes=750px alt="Philips Sonicare Power Flosser 5000" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/SK3AkvbieXm6b6z-yxDq-GecnPo=/fit-in/1500x3333/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PEO-philips-sonicare-power-flosser-5000-VickyWasik-0726-final.jpg-5a7b4c6ed56248e5b5cd4e4b8ce22163.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Vicky Wasik</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=4480 data-sizes=750px alt="Philips Sonicare Power Flosser 5000 " data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/s4_9UZntYUa-h533NNOEE4UJ430=/fit-in/1500x4480/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/water-flossers-test-philips-sonicare-power-5000-tstaples-459.jpg-53d97a2256b143429a7625ce2b34284a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Tamara Staples</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cordless-waterpik-wp-580-cordless-advanced-water-flosser></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Cordless</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Waterpik Cordless Water Flosser</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Waterpik Cordless Advanced Water Flosser" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/OTxz594mMsQF6JUclusbPCSWlfo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/waterpik-cordless-advanced-water-flosser-694b7035b63c4b8b8f2e3efb3335ca31.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Settings</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>It's easy to set up and use.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It includes a rechargeable battery.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It has the American Dental Association Seal of Acceptance.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We tried 12 Waterpik models in the Lab. Though a few of them fared well during testing, the brand's Cordless Advanced Water Flosser (WP-560) was our favorite. Earning perfect scores for ease of use and effectiveness, we liked how the intuitive two-button design left our teeth smooth and clear of debris.

The deviceâ€™s large water tank allowed us to floss for a whole 90 seconds without the need to refill the container (in fact, it was still half full of water when we were done). The handle felt small and easy to control, and the device itself was really easy to operate.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The one thing that we would change about this device is the length of the connecting cord from the base to the water pick itself, which felt a bit short and slightly limited reach.

The base has just two buttons, an on-off switch on the flosserâ€™s handle, and a pressure dial on the base that allows users to fine-tune the force of the water spray. That means that those with sensitive gums can easily control the water pressure to their liking and switch between powerful and gentle flossing. It also comes with eight water tips so that every member of the household can hygienically floss with the same device.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The tank is large enough to hold at least a minute's worth of usage, with water still left over to spare. We found that the nozzle required some fiddling to get into its proper seating so that no leaking occurred, but once we had it set up, the device felt intuitive and gentle. We also wish that it came with a timer function. Overall, we think this device makes for a great introduction to water flossing, especially for those who want to fine-tune their experience with adjustable pressure.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Power Source:</strong> Corded electric | <strong>Features:</strong> 10 pressure settings, 360-degree nozzle rotation, 8 tips | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 9 x 6 x 5 inches | <strong>Reservoir Capacity: </strong>600 milliliters</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Vicky Wasik</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-beginners-waterpik-cordless-express-water-flosser></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Beginners</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Waterpik Cordless Express</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Waterpik Cordless Express Water Flosser" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/M5ioVNwKjPaWwo9k8secEdws6qw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Waterpik-Cordless-Express-Water-Flosser-681c2dbe32004fadb9b385cd5e81dd3f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>It has a cordless design.</p></li><li><p>It's a great value.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It's convenient for travel.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It's easy to use right out of the box.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It turns out, you donâ€™t have to spend a lot of money to get your hands on an excellent cordless water flosser.

Once the nozzle is snapped in place, it doesnâ€™t move around at all, and the included instructions are clear and easy to follow.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While this cordless flosser might be simple, it packs a high-pressure punch. The Waterpik handle has just two settings â€” low and high â€” though we found that even the low setting felt pretty high-pressured. For this reason, those with more sensitive gums might find the pressure to be too much. Overall, though we do wish that there were more than two pressure setting options, we think that this wet flosser is a top-notch pick for beginners, thanks to its high pressure and ease of use.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Power Source:</strong> 3 AAA batteries | <strong>Features:</strong> 2 modes, 2 pressure levels, 2 brush speeds, 2 flossing tips | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 3.6 x 2.5 x 11.75 inches | <strong>Reservoir Capacity: </strong>5 ounces</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Tamara Staples</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-things-to-consider-when-buying-a-wet-flosser></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Things to Consider When Buying a Wet Flosser</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Settings</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Most wet flossers have multiple modes, such as pulse and steady stream. Many, like the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Turewell Water Flosser</a>, also allow you to change the speed or intensity of the water pressure.

The most important thing is that the wet flosser is user-friendly, comfortable, and easy to toggle between modes.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Reservoir Size</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The water that your wet flosser uses to operate is contained in a reservoir. Depending on the type of wet flosser you choose, the reservoir will either be attached to the flosser or the base of the unit. Small and portable wet flossers have a built-in reservoir that holds anywhere from five to 22 ounces of water. Larger, countertop units contain a separate reservoir in the base of the wet flosser that holds 150 to 600 milliliters of water.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Extra Features</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Water flossers often have other notable features beyond modes and pressure settings. This includes interchangeable heads, a 360-degree rotating nozzle, a built-in timer, rapid charging, a battery indicator light, a magnetic base, or a travel case. The <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">H2ofloss Water Flosser</a>, for example, is a wet flosser that comes with six different heads and a travel case.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Power Source</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When browsing models, pay attention to the power source.

Other wet flossers have corded designs, like the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Philips Sonicare Power Flosser 5000</a>, in which case the water reservoir is usually separate from the handheld flosser.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Portability</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You'll also want to consider the portability of your wet flosser.
