He officially began his basketball career as a rookie, after being drafted with the 30th overall pick by Chicago Bulls back on 9 December 2011. Hard for him, as he was selected the same year as another prolific player Derrick Rose in the same team <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Being on his shadow, he had a tough start to his career. But like an army on a mission, he never stirred back and worked hard, as of which he earned a long scale contract at Chicago Bulls for four years until 2015. He even became the Most Improved NBA player and made his first career All-Star nod&nbsp;on his period at Chicago Bulls. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Sit Back & Enjoy:&nbsp;</strong>Relieve Jimmy Buttler's top 10 plays of his career (Published on 24 June 2015)</p><p><strong>Discover:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Jasmine Mickael Jordan Wiki: Wedding Calls, Engaged To Rakeem Christmas</a></p><p>What's more, he is now the foundation of a top young NBA team, Philadelphia 76ers alongside Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h3><strong>Father & Mother Responsible For Jimmy's Rough Childhood; But Worked His Way Out To The Top</strong></h3><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Despite achieving success growing older, Jimmy, who was born on 14 September 1989 in&nbsp;Houston, Texas, had to share&nbsp;a reasonably rough childhood; he never had a family. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After Jimmy's&nbsp;father deserted&nbsp;him, his last hope was his mother. But sadly after his only hope, his mother also asked him to leave the house saying&nbsp;I don't like the look of you. You gotta go, his childhood became a very tough period for him as he had to find himself a shelter to live-in. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, it never meant the end of the world for him as he grew up in Texas with his friends; he even managed to complete&nbsp;his schooling from&nbsp;Tomball High School.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Not only did he gained his primary education there but also first touched the basketball.

As of which, he diverted his basketball plans and joined Tyler Junior College and then shifted to&nbsp;Marquette University.&nbsp;</p><p>Although he had his plans, such a talent like Jimmy was never meant to be wasted&nbsp;and it never really happened either.</p><p>As shortly after joining the University,&nbsp;Jimmy's raw talent was soon noticed by his brother Jordan Leslie,&nbsp;a freshman football and basketball player, who, not just provided him with a shelter to live in but also set him on his way to becoming one of the greatest NBA players&nbsp;of his time. &nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Another Top Talent:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Jordan Clarkson's New Alleged Super Model Girlfriend!
