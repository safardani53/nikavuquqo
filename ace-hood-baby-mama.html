And taking care of a child comes with major responsibility. So, it‚Äôs always important for parents to have a solid relationship with one another to achieve that goal. And history has shown that drama between parents can get in the way of children being taken care of appropriately.</p><p>Rapper <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ace Hood</a> (real name: Antoine McColister) has been very vocal about how much he loves his children. And when he was unable to spend time with them on Father‚Äôs Day, he shared his sentiments on social media. Now, many fans are wondering who his baby mama is and why there is so much drama between them. Get comfortable as we spill all of the tea.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ace Hood‚Äôs baby mama, Shanice Tyria, claims that the rapper owes her $95,000 in child support.</h2><p>Ace Hood‚Äôs baby mama, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shanice Tyria</a>, is not here for the rapper‚Äôs claims about not seeing his children on Father‚Äôs Day. After Ace shared his sentiments on social media, Shanice quickly chimed in with her reasoning. Messy!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>In a lengthy Instagram video reposted on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Shade Room</a>, Shanice shared that the rapper not only owes her $95,000, but he‚Äôs acting out due to his reality show endeavors.</p><p>‚ÄúYou really tried to come on here and get these people to try and destroy my character,‚Äù Shanice said on Instagram Live. ‚ÄúFor you and your wife to do that for a check for Love & Hip Hop? That is sad.‚Äù</p><p>Shanice also apparently wrote in an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram story</a>, seemingly about Ace: "When you about to join Love and Hip Hop Miami and need a storyline."</p><p>In her Instagram Live video, Shanice also put the rapper on blast for reportedly taking out a PPP loan for $144,000, but not being able to make good on his child support.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúWe reported it so now he has to pay me what he owes me and he‚Äôs mad,‚Äù Shanice shared on Instagram Live. ‚ÄúI let you go two years without doing anything so what are you talking about? Make it make sense. And y‚Äôall can look up the PPP loan. Y‚Äôall know it‚Äôs public records. Ace Hood Touring.

However, the general consensus is that Shanice's claims are serious enough to get Ace in trouble with the law, which is something she shouldn't want to see happen to the father of her children.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I‚Äôm glad Ace Hood got a nice wife bringing him peace cause his BM definitely trying to send homie to the feds.

With top-performing albums including ‚ÄúGutta,‚Äù ‚ÄúRuthless,‚Äù and ‚ÄúBlood Sweat & Tears,‚Äù Ace has established himself as a reputable hip-hop artist.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a> reports that Ace has accumulated a net worth of $5 million. This figure comes from his music landing in the Top 10 of the Billboard charts, successful mixtapes, and his work as a songwriter and producer.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Despite the back-and-forth going on with Ace and Shanice, the rapper should be able to spend time with their children.

And for the sake of their kids, we hope they can get it together.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrCmeceopp1lkpavunnMmqSa</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2face-hood-baby-mama.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2face-hood-baby-mama.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2face-hood-baby-mama.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2face-hood-baby-mama.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2face-hood-baby-mama.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2face-hood-baby-mama.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./susie-abromeits-boyfriend-list.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./susie-abromeits-boyfriend-list.html>Who is Susie Abromeit Dating Susie Abromeit's Boyfriend &amp;amp; Exes</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./nathan-stocker-19940704-html.html>Nathan Stocker (Guitarist) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./nathan-stocker-19940704-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
