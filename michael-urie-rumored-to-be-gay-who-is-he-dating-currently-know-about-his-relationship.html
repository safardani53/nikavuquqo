He is best known for his portrayal of Marc St. James on the ABC dramedy television series.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Due to the role as a gay in his series, people always used to make assumptions about his sexual orientation. <strong>Michael Urie</strong>, on the other hand, was never found dating a girl or having a romantic relationship. It was 2010 when he made a public announcement about his relationship.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Who was he in love with? Is it a girl or a boy? Let's find it&nbsp;in detail here in FamousStardom!</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Michael Urie identifies himself as a queer</h2><p>Portraying a role as a gay in his series Ugly Betty and keeping his love life a secret from the public has always raised a question regarding Michael Urie's sexuality. People&nbsp;started to assume that he is&nbsp;a gay.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Celebrity has to go through this kind of assumptions if they try to stay too far away from relationships. But, he does have&nbsp;a lot of fans who want&nbsp;to know about his dating story. Right? So, enough with the secret. Michael finally confronted and solved the mystery which the world was asking about.</p><p>via GIPHY</p><p>Michael who was completely keeping a secret about his personal life with the media finally came out with a definite answer regarding his sexuality as well as his ongoing love affair.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>He spoke during the interview with The Advocate in 2010 that he was dating a man and also&nbsp;emphasized that he does not want people to put a label on him as a gay.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>He made quite a bold statement while revealing about his sexuality. Let's look at it;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>“I’ve never been in. I’ve never said I was straight, and I’m not saying I’m gay now. I never lie, and I’ve never shied away from the topic. I’ve certainly chosen through my work to do things that promote the rights of LGBTQ people. I am not a hypocrite—certainly not now…I’ve been in a relationship for a while now, and if you just met the two of us together we’d be ‘gay.' But that somehow means anything that happened before [we met] didn’t count—and I don’t feel that way. I know that some people feel that way. They were with women, but it always felt wrong. But it didn’t for me. It felt right at the time. It didn’t work out, but it also didn’t work out with other men—many times. That’s why ‘gay’ never seemed right.”</p><p>Michael certainly made it clear that he cannot be referred to as a gay. While the media questioned&nbsp;him again and asked what exactly they could call him, he said&nbsp;<a href=#>he preferred the word queer.</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>There you have it! You have now got the answer. Now let's get to know about his boyfriend and their love life in detail!</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Michael is in a relationship with Ryan Spahn</h2><p>Not only Michael talked about his sexuality on the interview with The Advocate, but he even revealed who is he dating. He said he was in love with <strong>Ryan Spahn</strong> with whom he has been in a romantic relationship that continued for eight plus years till date.</p><p>Ryan is an American actor who is known for playing movies like , , and .<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>&nbsp;<img alt="Michael Urie is in a relationship with Ryan Spahn" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.out.com/sites/out.com/files/2015/10/12/750-michael-ryan_1.jpg ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>He mentioned that they met each other through a mutual friend <strong>Brooke Bloom</strong>. The couple even canceled each other on dates for years in the beginning. But their mutual friend Brooke planned their date unknowingly. Michael and Ryan's&nbsp;first date was enough to fall in love with each other. They must be thanking Brooke for the chance.</p><p>After&nbsp;numbers of dates, Michael said those three magical words to Ryan. Aww!</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Let's see what Ryan has to say about his dear loving boyfriend;</p><p>His sense of humor. His ability to find the joy in life. I tend to get more serious and introspective when I’m thinking about anything. I overthink it and he’s the opposite. Not that he isn’t analytical, but he’s spirited. I also just like the way he looks at me. It’s so sweet. I like that he twitches before he falls asleep and that he has full-on conversations, while he’s sleeping that I try to engage with...but it doesn’t seem to work out.</p><p>Bless the couple!</p><p>Also, Watch the interview of Michael!</p><p></p><p>We would like to congratulate Michael on his long relationship with&nbsp;loving boyfriend Ryan and wish them a better future ahead.</p><p>For more updates keep in touch with <strong>FamousStardom</strong>.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FSrZirnJ%2Bie6S7zGikopuYlrKtedSroJ5loqq6sL7EnWStp12Xsm6zwLJksKCfYra0eceeZJ2ZpJ67qHnCrqmrnZ6pubp5yqemsGWRl7y2wIyhoKxlopq5osDIqKWsoJml</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmichael-urie-rumored-to-be-gay-who-is-he-dating-currently-know-about-his-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmichael-urie-rumored-to-be-gay-who-is-he-dating-currently-know-about-his-relationship.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmichael-urie-rumored-to-be-gay-who-is-he-dating-currently-know-about-his-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmichael-urie-rumored-to-be-gay-who-is-he-dating-currently-know-about-his-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmichael-urie-rumored-to-be-gay-who-is-he-dating-currently-know-about-his-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmichael-urie-rumored-to-be-gay-who-is-he-dating-currently-know-about-his-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./newbury-races-winter-wonderland.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./newbury-races-winter-wonderland.html>Newbury races braced for backlash as 'Winter Wonderland' carnival in middle of track appears to bloc</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./michael-strahan-daughter-isabella-flaunts-figure.html>Michael Strahans daughter Isabella, 19, flaunts fit figure in pink bikini as she promotes modelin</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./michael-strahan-daughter-isabella-flaunts-figure.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
