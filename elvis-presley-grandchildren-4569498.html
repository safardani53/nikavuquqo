She has appeared in a number of notable films, including Zola, Mad Max: Fury Road, The Lodge, and Magic Mike. Riley has also dabbled in television, starring in The Girlfriend Experience and Riverdale. She starred <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Daisy Jones and the Six,</a> a 2023 miniseries centered on a fictional rock band’s coming-of-age. Inspired by the band Fleetwood Mac, the series was produced by <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Reese Witherspoon</strong></a> and her production company, Hello Sunshine. Riley’s performance in the show earned her nominations for a Golden Globe Award and a Primetime Emmy Award. Riley also hosted the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Christmas at Graceland&nbsp;special</a> at the iconic Graceland Estate.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>As for as her modeling career goes, Riley has graced the pages of Elle and Glamour UK, among others, and has appeared in campaigns for Louis Vuitton and Dior. The star has been married to <strong>Ben Smith-Petersen</strong>, a Hollywood stuntman, since 2015. They welcomed <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a daughter</a> via surrogate in August 2022.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>After Lisa Marie’s death, Riley and Priscilla <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>got into a legal battle</a> over the Graceland property and associated businesses. Riley was named the sole owner of Graceland in August 2023. Priscilla is still permitted to be buried at Graceland next to Elvis after she dies.</p><h2>Benjamin Keough</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Elvis-Presleys-Grandchildren-shutter-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Born on&nbsp;<span class="Eq0J8 LrzXr kno-fv">October 21, 1992 to Lisa Marie and first husband Danny, Benjamin was Elvis’ only grandson. He died on July 12, 2020 at the age of 27 from suicide. On what would have been his 28th birthday in 2020, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Lisa Marie paid tribute to her son</a> and reflected on the “suffocating” grief. “The depth of the pain is suffocating and bottomless without you every moment of every day,” she wrote. “I will never be the same. Please wait for me my love, and hold my hand while I stay to continue to protect and raise your little sisters and to be here for Riley. I know you would want that.”</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-8><span class="Eq0J8 LrzXr kno-fv">Prior to his passing, Benjamin appeared in two projects: Elvis by the Presleys, a TV film about his family, and the short Rod & Barry. </span>Back in 2012, Lisa Marie opened up about <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her son’s “uncanny” resemblance</a> to her late father, revealing that she sometimes gets “overwhelmed” looking at him. “He was at the Opry and was the quiet storm behind the stage,” she told CMT. “Everybody turned around and looked when he was over there. Everybody was grabbing him for a photo because it is just uncanny. Sometimes I am overwhelmed when I look at him.”</p><h2>Finley and Harper Lockwood</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>Born on October 7, 2008 to Lisa Marie and her fourth husband Michael (the two were married between 2006 and 2016), Finley and Harper (full names <strong>Finley Aaron Love Lockwood</strong> and <strong>Harper Vivienne Ann Lockwood</strong>, respectively) are Elvis’ youngest grandchildren and fraternal twins. (Twins run in the Presley family. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Elvis was born as a twin</a>, but his brother tragically died after his birth.)</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Finley and Harper regularly appeared on their mother’s Instagram page. Lisa Marie shared a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>celebratory photo with her three daughters</a> on her 53rd birthday in February 2021 and thanked everyone for the birthday wishes. “Like everyday, I couldn’t have made it through without these three by my side,” Lisa Marie wrote of Riley, Finley, and Harper. In her interview with CMT in 2012, Lisa Marie said that her late father’s “spirit lives in his grandchildren — very much.” She explained, “They’ve all got a little bit of him in them. They all have their own little traits, and I can just sense it, you know?”</p><h2><b>Tupelo Storm Smith-Petersen</b></h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>It was confirmed during Lisa’s <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Graceland memorial</a> that Riley and her husband <strong>Ben Smith-Petersen</strong> welcomed a daughter in secret. The couple, who wed in 2015, had not publicly acknowledged that they had a child until Ben made reference to the little girl as he read a letter written by Riley as a eulogy to her mother. “Thank you for showing me that love is the most important things in this life. I hope I can love my daughter the way you loved me,” Ben read from the note <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>at the service</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/riley-keough-baby-ss-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-14>Riley was also seen carrying a baby — seemingly their child — down the stairs of a private plane as <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>she arrived in Memphis</a> on January 21, 2023. A rep confirmed the same day that the pair had indeed welcomed their first baby.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>Riley finally revealed her daughter’s name — <strong>Tupelo Storm Smith-Petersen</strong> — in an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vanity Fair</a>&nbsp;in August 2023. Riley’s daughter’s name is a tribute to Elvis’ birthplace in Mississippi. Tupelo has the same middle name (Storm) as her late uncle Benjamin.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>“She’s literally like someone shrunk my husband and that’s our baby,” Riley said about her daughter. “This is the thing in my life so far that I have really wanted to, quote-unquote, get right. I don’t think you ever can be a perfect parent, but I would like to be the best mom for her that I can be.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8SlraKrXaW%2Fpr%2FLnrBmn6KWu6Wvx6KjnaqVo3p1gZVya3JwXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2felvis-presley-grandchildren-4569498.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2felvis-presley-grandchildren-4569498.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2felvis-presley-grandchildren-4569498.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2felvis-presley-grandchildren-4569498.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2felvis-presley-grandchildren-4569498.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2felvis-presley-grandchildren-4569498.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./clap-your-hands-challenge.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./clap-your-hands-challenge.html>TikToks Clap Your Hands Challenge Probably Isnt What You Think It Is</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./dog-bounty-hunter-lyssa-bra.html>Dog the Bounty Hunters daughter Lyssa Chapman wows in teeny sports bra after marking Coming Out D</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./dog-bounty-hunter-lyssa-bra.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
