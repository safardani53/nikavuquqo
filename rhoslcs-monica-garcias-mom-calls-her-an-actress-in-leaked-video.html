You lost sight and you were out of control at someone else’s house.” (Linda and Monica previously argued at <strong>Angie Katsanevas</strong>’ Greek Easter brunch, where <a href=#>Linda accused Monica</a> of making a scene.)</p><p>At one point in the video, Linda gave Monica two middle fingers.</p><p>“Thank you for coming over with this toxic s–t,” Monica replied before telling her mom to leave. The women continued to go back and forth calling each other “disgusting” before Linda eventually left Monica’s home.</p><p>During the RHOSLC season 4 finale on Tuesday, January 2, Monica admitted her involvement in the Instagram gossip account Reality Von Tease, which was initially created to take down <strong>Jen Shah</strong> but also trolled <strong>Heather Gay</strong>, <strong>Whitney Rose</strong>, <strong>Meredith Marks</strong> and <strong>Lisa Barlow</strong>. (Jen, 50, is <a href=#>currently in prison</a> after pleading guilty to fraud in July 2022.)</p><p>After the video appeared online, Monica hinted that <strong>Tenesha Luckett</strong> — her former friend and Heather’s hairstylist — was responsible for leaking the clip.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/RHOSLCs-Monica-Garcia-Addresses-Full-Blown-Takedown-in-Aftermath-of-Leaked-Fight-With-Her-Mom-Inline.jpg><p>“There has now been a ‘leaked’ private video filmed in my home between my mother and I. I sent the video to my best friend in confidence. We talked several times a day, spent every Sunday family dinner together, holidays, our children were best friends,” Monica wrote via her Instagram Story on Wednesday, January 3. “I never once thought she would do this to me, but here we are. She has been outing my secrets, she continues to release screenshots, recordings, videos, a folder she has dedicated to me full of things she plans to release. She is already doing interviews and has been contacting people in my life for months to try to destroy me.”</p><p>Monica’s Instagram post showed a screenshot of an apparent text message chain with Tenesha that showed Monica had sent Tenesha the original video.</p><p>“This is a full blown takedown but one of my once closest friends that my girls and I considered family. Brace for impact because she has a 3 year friendship of information she has just [been] waiting to be out there on me,” Monica continued. “If you don’t see what’s happening here, I don’t know what else to say, but screenshots released by my best friend, videos everything happening to me exactly like what was done on Reality Von Tease.”</p><p>She concluded by apologizing to her mom. “I shared this video with my best friend,” Monica wrote. “It was not meant to get out. I did not leak this.”</p><p>In a separate upload, Monica shared a screen recording of Tenesha’s Instagram Story, in which the hairstylist admitted to having a “folder” dedicated to Monica. According to Tenesha, she has more than 1,500 screenshots proving Monica’s involvement in Reality Von Tease.</p><p>During the season finale, Monica claimed that she was only responsible for the Reality Von Tease posts that were about Jen. The posts about the other women were allegedly shared by the other people behind the account, which Monica said included Tenesha and at least one former employee of Jen’s.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>A teaser for the season 4 reunion promised that Monica will further address the Reality Von Tease situation when she sits down with <strong>Andy Cohen</strong> and her costars. “We have a lot to discuss,” Andy, 55, says in the trailer before asking Monica, “Can you own that you hurt all of them?”</p><p>Part 1 of The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City reunion will air on Bravo Tuesday, January 9, at 8 p.m. ET. The episode will be available to stream the next day via Peacock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaroJ%2BouaS%2FjKamp6GTlnqordGcoJqrXaK8rnnCmqOlq12dsrN5wKdkmpukp7K0v4yipWaklZa4prCMr6CdnZ9k</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frhoslcs-monica-garcias-mom-calls-her-an-actress-in-leaked-video.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2frhoslcs-monica-garcias-mom-calls-her-an-actress-in-leaked-video.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2frhoslcs-monica-garcias-mom-calls-her-an-actress-in-leaked-video.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2frhoslcs-monica-garcias-mom-calls-her-an-actress-in-leaked-video.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frhoslcs-monica-garcias-mom-calls-her-an-actress-in-leaked-video.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2frhoslcs-monica-garcias-mom-calls-her-an-actress-in-leaked-video.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kung-fu-panda-legends-of-awesomeness.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kung-fu-panda-legends-of-awesomeness.html>Stream Movies, Shows &amp;amp; Live TV</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./primal-groudon-raid-guide-pokemon-go.html>Primal Groudon Raid Guide for Pokmon GO</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./primal-groudon-raid-guide-pokemon-go.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
