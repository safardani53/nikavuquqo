My lawyer is going to contact your lawyer," he told the group.</p><p>It is understood&nbsp;that the coworkers argued that the pool was based on the group's "no pay, no play" rule.</p><p>They were expected to add that the pool was not a regular occurrence but would be arranged randomly when the jackpot was above £17.7million ($30million).</p><p>But Bates wasn't the only worker to claim a portion of the winnings.</p><p>Those who felt that they missed out on the prize money were in the pool but missed the&nbsp;<a href=#>life-changing draw&nbsp;</a>in 2011.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>The payout by lottery officials was paused amid the various claims which were put forward.</p><p>However, all but two of the claims were rejected.</p><p>The lottery organisation divided the jackpot 26 ways -&nbsp;&nbsp;the <a href=#>court</a> held&nbsp;two of the shares pending resolution of the claims.</p><p>In Toronto, a 10-day civil trial was held to determine if Bates was qualified to receive a share.</p><p>He&nbsp;stated in his deposition that he addressed Sherif Morsi, the group leader, after returning from his <a href=#>winter</a> holiday.</p><p>He said he asked Morsi: "Why didn't you put in for me?"</p><p>According to Bates's testimony, Mori said he failed to enter Bates because another employee still owed him <a href=#>money</a>.</p><p>Bates's lawyer Michael Cochrane argued that as his client was a regular player, the fellow group members had a duty of good faith.</p><p>But on the second day, a settlement was struck, ending the case overseen by Judge Carole Brown.</p><p>The lawyer for the 24 workers, Saul Glober, stated at the time that the terms of the unreported agreement remained confidential.</p><p>Glober added that his clients were happy with the result and to draw the issue to a close.</p><p>Meanwhile Cochrane gave other lottery pool players some advice.</p><p>"You need to pay attention. Just throwing $5 (£3) in an envelope isn't enough," he said.</p><p>He added that leaders of the pool need to be aware of their responsibilities, from holding money, buying&nbsp;<a href=#>tickets</a>&nbsp;under the agreement of the group, and distributing the winnings.</p><p>Players also need to pay in enough time, know who the players are and the group leader, and to establish what happens when a win is made.</p><p>It comes after a <a href=#>pensioner spent 25 painful years trying to prove that he once won a £2million lottery prize</a> but lost the golden ticket.</p><p>Robert Clemett, from&nbsp;<a href=#>Sydney,</a>&nbsp;claims that he hadn't realised the jackpot was his until a story about the unclaimed prize aired on TV four years later.</p><p>On September 23, 1997, the Oz&nbsp;<a href=#>Lotto</a>&nbsp;draw was supposed to produce three big winners.</p><p>Instead, one huge jackpot has remained unclaimed - the largest outstanding prize in&nbsp;<a href=#>New South Wales'</a>&nbsp;history.</p><p>Clemett has spent decades fighting for the prize money after he said he realised his mistake while watching a broadcast about unclaimed lottery prizes in 2021.</p><p>He then immediately wrote to the lottery company to demand his win.</p><p>He alleges that he bought the all-important ticket for £32 at a newsagents and that it included a game with six winning numbers.</p><p>He has provided the details of the time and date of his purchase, the number of games he played, the type of ticket and the exact composition of numbers.</p><p>In 2014, he sued the state lottery over the unclaimed £2million but his case was dismissed by the judge.</p><p>Roughly 50 people have contacted New South Wales (NSW) Lotteries to claim the windfall.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ4Jyf49tZ25nnZa7br%2FUnqpmr5%2BnuG6vzqWjnpmXqrK0edKypZ2hk5bBpnnWoqVmoJ%2BhtqWt2Gg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fman-sues-work-colleagues-syndicate-win-holiday.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fman-sues-work-colleagues-syndicate-win-holiday.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fman-sues-work-colleagues-syndicate-win-holiday.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fman-sues-work-colleagues-syndicate-win-holiday.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fman-sues-work-colleagues-syndicate-win-holiday.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fman-sues-work-colleagues-syndicate-win-holiday.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./documentary-mormon-vegan-sex-pill.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./documentary-mormon-vegan-sex-pill.html>Shocking true story of how a Mormon &amp;amp; a vegan made millions with law-breaking natural sex pill</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./sascha-ferguson.html>Fame | Sascha Ferguson net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./sascha-ferguson.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
