<time>29 Apr 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>BACHELORETTE stars Gabby Windey and Erich Schwer have secretly split, according to Dancing With The Stars fans who think they've spotted evidence of a breakup.</p><p>Gabby dropped a few clues during the live show that led fans to this conclusion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/michael-buble-night-cast-feeling-770620704.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/ring-alarm-dwts-fans-believe-770620226.jpg><p>On Monday night's episode of <a href=#>DWTS</a>, <a href=#>Gabby</a> and her partner, Val Chmerkovskiy danced a rumba to <a href=#>Michael Buble</a>'s song Home.</p><p>While they got some help from Val's wife, <a href=#>Jenna Johnson</a>, due to the nature of the dance, fans noticed a detail in her package that raised their eyebrows.</p><p>Gabby was not wearing her engagement ring in her package or during the dance, when she normally wears it on the show.</p><p>This led fans to believe that she and <a href=#>Erich</a> had split.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE GABBY WINDEY">READ MORE GABBY WINDEY</h2><p>Another clue was that he was not in the audience on Monday.</p><p>Erich is <a href=#>normally in the crowd</a>, alongside Gabby's fellow <a href=#>Bachelorette</a> contestant, <a href=#>Rachel Recchia</a>, but was nowhere to be seen last night or last Tuesday.</p><p>However, with how steamy Gabby and Val's dance was, he might not have wanted to have been there to see it in person.</p><p>Gabby typically posted a lot of photos of her and Erich together on her <a href=#>Instagram</a>, but hasn't posted anything about him for over two weeks.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>However, she has not deleted the photos of them together from her profile.</p><h2>DID THEY SPLIT?</h2><p>Fans took to social media to explain why they think the couple split up.</p><p>Along with pointing out the clues above, some <a href=#>Reddit</a> users gave tell-tale signs that the reality TV couple is no more.</p><p>"Jenna Johnson used to follow Erich, she unfollowed at some point," pointed out one fan.</p><p>"Gabby hasn’t been wearing her ring and this isn’t just for her dances. She hasn’t been wearing it out (not with friends, not at this weekends Halloween party)," they also said.</p><p>Another fan chimed in: "They don’t seem to prioritize each other or the relationship. That is usually the most obvious sign that a couple won’t make it - which is why I kept saying the spoiler thread was just fighting over who gets to share her joint post in a few months. But I suspect a breakup won’t be announced until after DWTS is over."</p><p>"Yeah I had the same thought that they broke up over the weekend. Probably just waiting to announce it," wrote one fan.</p><p>"Time and time again, everyone tries to deny it but the evidence is there. At the minimum it’s a rough patch," suggested a Reddit user.</p><p>One Bachelorette fan pointed out: "Usually when a Bachelorette starts taking her ring off though, that means broken engagement like....99% of the time."</p><p>But at the same time, the thread posters also listed reasons for why they could still be together.</p><p>Rachel and their friends still follow both Gabby and Erich on social media.</p><p>Erich also liked comments about teaching Gabby to surf, and has liked Val's posts and DWTS posts about Gabby.</p><h2>AWKWARD DANCE</h2><p>Early on in the competition, host <a href=#>Alfonso Ribeiro</a> <a href=#>confused Gabby with a question</a> that caught her off-guard, and he threw shade at the reality TV contestant.</p><p>The actor said on&nbsp;<a href=#>Live With Kelly and Ryan</a>&nbsp;that she "didn't understand him" during an awkward moment on TV.</p><p>When the show came back from the break, they showed a clip of him talking to the&nbsp;Bachelorette&nbsp;contestant&nbsp;after her performance.</p><p>"Congratulations on your engagement! Now is Val making it very difficult for Erich for your first dance?" Alfonso asked.</p><p>She laughed, looked at her partner, and then asked the host: "What?"</p><p>Alfonso explained that he was trying to ask her if he was making it hard on their first dance for their wedding because "Val's really good."</p><p><a href=#>Kelly Ripa</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Ryan Seacrest</a>&nbsp;both said "Ohhh."</p><p>"And so, that was the question that she didn't understand," the host said.</p><p>Kelly boiled over in laughter as Ryan tried to go on with the segment, but stopped when Kelly folded over her chair.</p><p>"You have the first dance. You know when you get married," Alfonso joked.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"That show that you were on, The Bachelorette, the whole goal is to get married. You know? No? Ok. Alright. Let's go to the scores."</p><p>The hosts continued to laugh at the actor's antics and then moved on from the awkward moment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/1903-gabby-rachel-enter-crucial-750380191.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/michael-buble-night-cast-feeling-770620701.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/ring-alarm-dwts-fans-believe-770620309.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huZWd%2Fd3%2BTaJuwrKNis6K60maZmpuYmrmwvsStq55ll5avo8WMsKCnnJWueqa%2ByJyfZquTncSmvoysp6WhpGKwrcHErGY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdwts-fans-bachelorette-gabby-windey-erich-schwer-split-clues.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdwts-fans-bachelorette-gabby-windey-erich-schwer-split-clues.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdwts-fans-bachelorette-gabby-windey-erich-schwer-split-clues.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdwts-fans-bachelorette-gabby-windey-erich-schwer-split-clues.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdwts-fans-bachelorette-gabby-windey-erich-schwer-split-clues.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdwts-fans-bachelorette-gabby-windey-erich-schwer-split-clues.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./andrew-doyle-comedian.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./andrew-doyle-comedian.html>Fame | Andrew Doyle (comedian) net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./covid-comes-to-the-bachelorette-who-was-forced-out.html>COVID Comes to The Bachelorette: Who Was Forced Out?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./covid-comes-to-the-bachelorette-who-was-forced-out.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
