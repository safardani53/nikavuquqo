<time>31 Jan 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>KANYE West's plan to move Donda Academy to an LA church has fallen through after more than 12,000 people signed a petition pleading for the pastor to turn him away, The U.S. Sun has exclusively revealed.</p><p><a href=#>Kanye</a> was interested in&nbsp;leasing space at Cornerstone Christian Church, Northridge in LA's San Fernando Valley after attending services at the place of <a href=#>worship</a>, according to <a aria-label="TMZ (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a> in November 2022.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/kanye-west-seen-13-2023-836044394.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/shot-us-sun-cornerstone-church-835902813.jpg><p>Pastor&nbsp;Ronald Nagin told the outlet he’d had face-to-face meetings with the star, and considered him a good guy and a friend despite him being dropped by multiple big-name fashion brands for his&nbsp;<a href=#>anti-Semitic remarks</a>.</p><p>Ye's $15,000-a-year private school <a href=#>Donda Academy</a> began on a ranch and later moved to a warehouse-style campus in San Fernando Valley, and the plan was to uproot the <a href=#>school</a> again to the church.</p><p>But a source at Cornerstone Christian Church exclusively told The U.S. Sun this week that Kanye is not leasing the space after plans fell through, although he has hosted <a href=#>Sunday Service</a> at the venue.</p><p>"Kanye has had Sunday Service here, but now it's just the regular church, and Ronald has left as well, he's at a different place," the staffer revealed.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Donda Academy ">Donda Academy</h2><p>Asked if they would welcome Kanye's Donda Academy, the source added: "No, not now, we haven't heard from him. And because of anti-Semitism, people were very upset about the idea."</p><p>A separate source confirmed to The U.S. Sun that the school is still operating at the warehouse in San Fernando Valley, but the children are currently on summer break.</p><h2>ANGRY PARISHIONERS</h2><p>More than 12,000 people signed a petition to stop him from moving it to Cornerstone and parishioners wrote an open letter to Pastor Nagin, pleading with him to turn the rapper away.</p><p>The petition was launched by a group called <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Faithful America</a>, which&nbsp;bills itself&nbsp;as "the largest online community of grassroots Christians acting for social justice."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>The group stated: "Ye, the rapper previously known as Kanye West, has been losing sponsors and contracts left and right over his harmful antisemitism - yet one California pastor says Ye's recent hatred isn't a dealbreaker for their Christian business partnership.</p><p>"On December 1, Ye clutched a Bible and shockingly said 'I see good things about Hitler' and 'I like Hitler' during an appearance on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones's show InfoWars. He has previously tweeted other threats and conspiracy theories about Jewish people."</p><p>The letter to Nagin read: "As your fellow Christians, we strongly object to the possibility of Cornerstone Church renting space to Ye (Kanye West).</p><p>"There is no room in God's house for hatred. Allowing Ye's Donda Academy to operate out of a place of worship would give it and him credibility that at this point they do not deserve.</p><p>"As your siblings in Christ, we ask you not to host Ye's unaccredited private school on your church grounds."</p><h2>TEACHER LAWSUITS</h2><p>Although there were originally more than 80 students children attending classes, according to reports, The U.S. Sun can confirm the numbers continue to dwindle.</p><p>While many parents have been reluctant to speak about the future of Donda amid reports they have signed NDAs, a source close to Kanye&nbsp;said he's keen to keep it open.</p><p>But it's been a struggle for Ye, who has been hit by two lawsuits from former teachers and staffers at the school.</p><p>In one filed in April, several former teachers claimed wrongful termination against the academy, according to <a href=# aria-label="NBC (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">NBC</a>.</p><p>Those teachers claimed that the school didn't have a custodial or medical staff.</p><p>It was also alleged that there was a lot of bullying at the ill-fated school and Kanye had bizarre rules including a ban on any non-Yeezy or black clothes as well as the use of forks.</p><h2>STUDENTS FED SUSHI</h2><p>According to the lawsuit, he&nbsp;provided only sushi for lunch and did not let the students have classes on the second floor because he was "afraid of stairs."</p><p>Another lawsuit filed just last month in&nbsp;<a href=#>Los Angeles</a>&nbsp;County Superior Court claims that the school, formerly Yeezy Christian Academy, had sanitation and electrical issues when it was located at the ranch.</p><p>The documents state the septic tank overflowed multiple times, there was no hot water, and an electrical fire started in the school.</p><p>On top of that, the plaintiff said that <a href=#>windows and skylights were left open</a> to the elements because Kanye didn't like glass.</p><p>Kanye's team did not respond to calls from The U.S. Sun regarding Donda Academy's planned move.</p><p>But a lawyer for Ye,&nbsp;Gregory Suhr, has denied allegations made by the former teachers, saying depictions of Donda Academy as a “dystopian institution designed to satisfy Ye's idiosyncrasies” were false.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>Yeezy</a>&nbsp;rapper launched&nbsp;<a href=#>Donda Academy</a>, a school named after his late mother that provided&nbsp;<a href=#>Balenciaga</a>&nbsp;uniforms.</p><p><a href=#>Donda Academy</a>&nbsp;claims to be able to provide its students with a world-class education including its "rigorous core curriculum, and an emphasis on sustainability, creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
