<a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">buy here</a>.</p><p>Amazon has the Huawei Display 23.8 Inch FHD Monitor for £98.99, saving £51 - <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">buy here</a>.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">More Laptop and Tablet Deals</h3></p><h2>When is Black Friday 2021?</h2><p>This year, Black Friday is taking place on November 26 - get that date in your diary right now!</p><p>But when you do, keep in mind that you're likely to find plenty of monitor deals (and deals across the board) appear online ahead of the big day itself.</p><p>Each year, the Black Friday sales seem to kick off earlier and earlier, with some retailers launching teaser sales even as far in advance as the beginning of November.</p><p>Typically, however, the best deals are held back for the week of Black Friday (commencing Monday November 22), but we suggest you bookmark this page and check in at least a week before then.</p><h2>Do monitors go on sale for Black Friday?</h2><p>Yes! Black Friday is a great time to find a major bargain.</p><p>In past years, monitor retailers have offered savings of as much as 50%, which makes a huge difference when you're shelling out for a big purchase like this.</p><h2>When will monitor Black Friday deals start in 2021?</h2><p>Many retailers begin their Black Friday sale ahead of the day itself, with deals from early November - so keep your eyes peeled.</p><p>Sometimes you can find fantastic early bird offers.</p><h2>When will monitor Black Friday deals end in 2021?</h2><p>The Black Friday sales weekend usually runs right through until Cyber Monday.</p><p>So, that Monday is generally your last chance to score a deal. Make sure you get your shopping done by then.</p><h2>How much are monitors on Black Friday?</h2><p>Monitors vary in price, depending on whether you want to find a top of the range model or a cheaper alternative. At the moment, you can get a good model for less than £100, or go up to the latest models at £800.</p><p>But the good news is that you'll likely see big savings on Black Friday, with hundreds of pounds off some monitors. Do your homework ahead of time, so that you know which monitor you want, how it's priced before Black Friday, and which retailer is offering the biggest bargain.</p><h2>What monitor deals were there last Black Friday?</h2><p>During last year's Black Friday sales, we saw price drops across a selection of monitor brands, one notable example being Dell.</p><p>The brand itself offered savings of up to 50% on its range of Alienware monitors - that's quite the discount.</p><p>Across the board, we saw an increase in deals being offered on 4K monitors, so if you're seeking out an option with Ultra HD resolution, we're confident there'll be plenty to choose from this year.</p><h2>Where to expect the best Black Friday monitor deals</h2><p>You'll find the very best monitor deals from a number of retailers and manufacturers, which we've listed below.</p><li>Acer - <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">shop monitors here</a></li><li>Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">shop monitors here</a></li><li>AO - <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">shop monitors here</a></li><li>Argos - <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">shop monitors here</a></li><li>Currys PC World - <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">shop monitors here</a></li><li>Dell - <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">shop monitors here</a></li><li>HP - <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">shop monitors here</a></li><li>John Lewis - <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">shop monitors here</a></li><li>Very - <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">shop monitors here</a></li><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">More Amazing Black Friday Deals</h3></p><h2>When is Cyber Monday 2021?</h2><p>Cyber Monday is always on the other side of the weekend that immediately follows Black Friday: this year, that's November 29.</p><p>While it was always traditionally a day of online-only deals - hence the slightly retro-sounding name - there's now very little to distinguish it from Black Friday.</p><p>Very few retailers put deals exclusively in-store these days, so you'll find just as many online deals available on Black Friday.</p><p>Yes, the Monday is an opportunity to send out their final deals and lower prices further - but if you see a cracking monitor on Black Friday, our advice is to not hang about and wait to see if it gets any better.</p><h2>What specs should I look for when buying a monitor on Black Friday?</h2><p>The first thing to look for when picking your monitor is HD (or FHD or Full HD) vs 4K (or UHD or Ultra HD). The latter is filled with more pixels, and so puts out a better image, than most HD monitors. But it's a big price difference and you'll likely only need 4K if you're a gamer or require it for work.</p><p>Viewing wise, you'll want to check the brightness, colour support and HDR (high dynamic range). That refers to the colour spectrum that your monitor has - basically, whether you get a brighter picture, and if you can view dark scenes more easily.</p><p>If you're a gamer, look at refresh rates too - you want your monitor to produce images that keep up with play. But that's less vital for non-gamers, so this is another possible saving.</p><p>And you'll also see that some monitors have curved screens. That gives you a more immersive viewing experience, but they take up more space, so flat monitors are better in a small living space, on your desk, or if you're keeping an eye on your budget.</p><h2>What are some of the best monitors to buy in 2021?</h2><p>Here are some of the leading models to look out for.</p><li>BenQ PD3200U, £598.99 at Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">buy here</a></li><li>Dell 4K S3221QS Curved Monitor, £349 at Very.co.uk - <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">buy here</a></li><li>LG 32UN880 UltraFine Display Ergo, £596.99 at Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">buy here</a></li><li>Asus Designo Curve MX38VC, £923.59 at Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">buy here</a></li><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MORE BLACK FRIDAY DEALS</h2></p><p>For plenty more great tech offers beside Black Friday monitor deals, take a look at our <a href=#>Currys PC World Black Friday deals</a> page.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Gaming fans should also head to our pick of the best <a href=#>Nintendo Switch Black Friday</a> deals.</p><p>And if you're after a screen of a different kind, don't miss our <a href=#>TV Black Friday deals</a> article.</p><p>If you click on a link in this story we may earn affiliate revenue.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqysp2Wjmrmmr9OsZmpuYGh%2Fc4CXaJmlmZOgeqe%2ByJ2YsmWdpLuqwM6rZJ2dkaHAcA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fblack-friday-monitor-deals.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fblack-friday-monitor-deals.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fblack-friday-monitor-deals.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fblack-friday-monitor-deals.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fblack-friday-monitor-deals.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fblack-friday-monitor-deals.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./discontinued-dunkin-foods.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./discontinued-dunkin-foods.html>Five discontinued Dunkin' foods you'll never see again - and customers are stunned it's no longer av</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jenna-ushkowitz-michael-trevino-pics.html>[PHOTOS] Jenna Ushkowitz &amp;amp; Michael Trevino Glee &amp;amp; TVD Stars Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jenna-ushkowitz-michael-trevino-pics.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
