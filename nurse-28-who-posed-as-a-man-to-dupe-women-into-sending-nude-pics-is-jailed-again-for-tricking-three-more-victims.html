I don’t feel safe in my house’.”</p><p>The woman was contacted on dating app Tinder and Instagram by Rennie and even shared flirty texts and calls where Rennie said her alter ego drove a black Jaguar and lived in Troon, Ayrshire.</p><p>But when the mum went to check out the pad with a pal, they discovered no flash motor outside.</p><p>She recalled: “I knew then this person was not who they said they were.</p><p>“But at this point I still thought it was a guy.</p><p>“I phoned the police and told them I was concerned because they knew where I lived.”</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">HER VICTIMS: Rennie's history of scams</h3></p><p>Adele Rennie was jailed for 22 months in prison in November 2017 after pleading guilty to&nbsp;18 charges against ten women.</p><p>The charges included ten counts of stalking, four of sexual coercion and four of indecent communication.</p><p>The young woman was also placed on the sex offenders register after targeting her victims.</p><p><strong>Victim One</strong></p><p>Rennie posed as two men, David Crolla and David Graham, during the ruse. She also used voice-changing technology.</p><p><strong>Victim Two</strong></p><p>The ex-nurse sent sexually explicit messages, convincing her victim to send her naked photos.</p><p><strong>Victim Three</strong></p><p>Rennie messaged photographs of a naked man to her victim.</p><p><strong>Victim Four</strong></p><p>Rennie black-mailed one of her victims, using medical records she had accesssed.</p><p><strong>Victim Five</strong></p><p>Rennie posed as a man called Matthew, asking for naked pictures.</p><p><strong>Victim Six</strong></p><p>Rennie exchanged sexually explicit messages with her victim</p><h2>'I DIDN'T FEEL SAFE'</h2><p>The victim revealed she got back in touch with her alleged love interest to “call his bluff".</p><p>She added: “He sent me a message saying he had been talking to a computer expert at his work who could tell him pretty much everything I am doing.</p><p>“That was very disturbing and threatening. I just thought, ‘Oh f***’. By this time I was staying at my mum’s. I didn’t feel safe.”</p><p>Cops advised her to keep messaging before a friend’s Google search found Rennie’s cruel past.</p><p>The victim said: “I knew it was Adele because it was so similar. Police told me they were pretty sure she would have followed me.</p><p>“It was the same officer who dealt with her the first time.</p><p>"He was flabbergasted and couldn’t believe she would do it again.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><p>Ex-nurse Rennie, of Kilmarnock, yesterday admitted tricking the mum of two and persuading her to send pictures and a video at the town’s sheriff court.</p><p>She also pleaded guilty to causing fear and alarm to a woman in Milngavie, near Glasgow, and another targeted in her past con.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT000368303390.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT000373989625-e1560343844149.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT000373989623.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT000366635007-e1560343395398.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT000373991424-e1560343966945.jpg><br><p><b>We pay for your stories!
