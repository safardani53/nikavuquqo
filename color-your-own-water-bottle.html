Here are a few ideas you can share with your kids when they’re using the crafting kit for water bottles:</p><h4>Ribbon stripes</h4><p>Give the bottle a pop of color and a nice texture with strands of ribbon. Different ribbon widths, colors, and dimensions you apply the stripes in can create a nice design. You can overlap wide and narrow ribbon stripes, or simply round up stripes around the body to add design interest. Save ribbon from water damage by applying decoupage glue on top.</p><h4>Collage</h4><p>Let your kids collect cutouts from their favorite magazines and photos and use them on the water bottle to create a collage. Use decoupage glue to attach the cutouts.</p><h4>Glass paints</h4><p>Glass paints transform your bottle to look just like a stained glass window. Create lead lines with permanent markers on your bottle and paint into them. Liquid leading can also be used for this purpose. You’ll have to use a clear paint sealer on top or spray a little polyurethane spray to make the paint stay.</p><h4>Vinyl stickers</h4><p>Vinyl stickers come in a huge variety. Vinyl stickers are completely waterproof and are great for bottles you take along on your outdoor activities such as hikes and camping. If you’re using paper stickers, make sure you enamel them with decoupage glue to protect them.</p><h3>How to Pick a Water Bottle Coloring Craft Kit</h3><p>Here are a few considerations you should keep in mind when buying a water bottle for coloring:</p><h4>Ease of use</h4><p>Make sure that the bottle is easy to use for your kid. This includes the weight, height, and bottle cover. A water bottle can weigh from 9 to 16 ounces. Pick a bottle that your child can decorate and take along to school, it should be able to fit into lunch boxes and small hands.</p><p>The cover should securely seal the bottle but should be easy to open and close. If you’re picking a bottle for a young (2-3-year-old) child, prefer getting a bottle with straw spouts as that’s easy for kids to operate.</p><h4>Easy to clean</h4><p>Since kids like to play and get things dirty, the bottle you pick for them should be easy to clean. It’s better if the bottle has certain parts that can be taken apart to clean and wash separately. You can check to see if the bottle is dishwasher safe. Avoid getting bottles with tight crevices as that’s a favored spot for mold and mildew to grow.</p><h4>Leak-proof</h4><p>Look for a bottle that has a rubber seal in its cup to prevent spills and leaks to the most extent. You can check to see the closure type, and read customer reviews about the product before purchasing.</p><h4>Material</h4><p>Crafting kit water bottles are made from stainless steel or plastic. <a href=#>Stainless steel bottles</a> might seem a bit heavy for small kids in comparison to plastic ones. However, when buying a plastic coloring water bottle, make sure that you’re completely satisfied with the safety of plastic used. It should be BPA and toxins-free.</p><h4>Decorations</h4><p>The quality of the decorations or colors in the color of your own water bottle kit should be considered to avoid unnecessary and premature wear. The paints and decorative items used should stick to the bottle securely.</p><h3>Buying Tips for Color Your Own Water Bottle Kits</h3><p>Some tips to follow:</p><ul><li>Ensure that the bottle decorating kit you buy is age-appropriate.
