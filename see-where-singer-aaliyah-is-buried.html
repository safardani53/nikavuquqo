And when Aaliyah saw the size of the plane, she then refused to board it, he recounts in the book.</p><p>At the same time, members of her entourage were reportedly arguing with the pilot after he told them the plane would be too heavy for eight passengers and all of their luggage.</p><p>“[The airport staff] and Aaliyah had the common sense that the plane was overweight,” Russell&nbsp;says in the book,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">as reported by the Beast</a>.</p><p>The 22-year-old, complaining she had a headache, then climbed back into the taxi van and laid down on the back seat for a quick nap.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000670626066-1.jpg><p>Eventually, Russell says, a member of Aaliyah's team came to check on her.</p><p>During the exchange, Russell says the singer reiterated that she didn't want to get on the small plane and wasn't feeling well.</p><p>The team member then handed Aaliyah a pill, Russel claims, which she took before falling "into a deep sleep".</p><p>Aaliyah was allegedly still in the slumber when the pilot finally caved and allowed her and her team to board the flight back to Florida.</p><p>“They took her out of the van; she didn’t even know she was getting boarded on a plane,” Russell&nbsp;recounts in the book. "She went on the airplane asleep.”</p><p>The flight took off at 6.50 pm. Unfortunately, it had only got between 60 and 100 feet in the air before nosediving back down to the ground.</p><p>Aaliyah and six of the eight others on board were killed instantly. Two others died in hospital.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>One of those passengers was the singer's security guard.
