<time>02 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>EVEN more fans will soon be thanking ABBA for the music after the group secretly extended their run of shows in London.</p><p>The 90-minute state-of-the-art <a href=#>Abba Voyage</a> concerts are currently booked up online until May next year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000736069447.jpg><p>However, I can reveal <a href=#>the show’s run</a> has now been extended until spring 2026.</p><p>Thanks to huge demand, some of the most sought-after tickets in specially ­created “Dance Booths” have sold out nine months in advance.</p><p>A source said: “Everyone knows Abba has a seriously loyal fan base but the show was always a bit of a gamble.</p><p>“No one really knew how the Abba-tars were going to be received, as similar hologram-style concerts were a mixed bag. But for Abba the reaction was amazing. Even those most sceptical about the tech have walked away impressed.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="MORE ON ABBA">MORE ON ABBA</h2><p>“The plan is to refresh the show with new songs that have already been shot by the group.”</p><p>Before it opened in May this year, the show — <a href=#>which takes place at the purpose-built Abba Arena in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park</a> in East London — was surrounded in secrecy.</p><p>While it features a live band and backing singers in person, the group, made up of <a href=#>Agnetha Faltskog</a>, <a href=#>Bjorn Ulvaeus</a>, <a href=#>Benny Andersson</a> and <a href=#>Anni-Frid Lyngstad</a>, performs as Abba-tars — hologram-type versions of themselves locked in their youthful Seventies heyday.</p><p>I understand talks are still ongoing for the show to transfer to <a href=#>Las Vegas </a>and take up residency on the iconic strip.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>In November last year, Abba released their ninth and final album, Voyage.</p><p>The record topped charts around the world — including in the UK.<br>Insisting they have ruled out any more new music, Bjorn previously told The Sun: “When you do a thing like that, you don’t know how people will receive it.</p><p>“It was with such pride that we released that album.</p><p>“I don’t think there will be any more music with Abba. I think that was ­definitely our last album.”</p><p>However, he went on to let slip that he had already thought up plans to keep fans coming back.</p><p>“We did more songs than we knew we were going to use. So there is more material,” he said.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>GOOD HABITS BY ED ’N’ HORIZON</h2><p>ON Saturday I exclusively revealed how Ed Sheeran was planning to make a surprise appearance alongside Bring Me The Horizon at Reading Festival.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000756235530.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/182619c1-e219-48bb-af5b-221432a8e346.jpg><p>And fans got just that – as the Shape Of You singer joined the rock band on the Main Stage West to perform their mash- up of Ed’s hit Bad Habits.</p><p>While Megan Thee Stallion had all heads turning with her sexy corset, Ed dressed in black for his slot with frontman Oli Sykes, who wowed crowds with a blistering set in a black jumpsuit covered in white hearts.</p><p>BMTH and Ed first revealed their version of Bad Habits at the Brit Awards in ­February, and after it landed rave reviews they have talked about collaborating again.</p><p>Oli said: “We’re talking about it. We’ve been emailing and figuring out what it could sound like. I think Ed’s really excited about it and we are too.”</p><p>Also storming the stages at Leeds and Reading were Ellie Rowsell and her band Wolf Alice, Willow Smith, Griff, Madison Beer and veteran headliners Alex Turner and the Arctic Monkeys.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>SAM: RAYE THEN RAYA</h2><p>HE enjoyed a string of dates with singer Raye after they were spotted getting cosy at a party following the Brit Awards.</p><p>But I can reveal Sam Fencer is still looking for love and has joined exclusive dating app Raya to try to find The One.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000697346442.jpg><p>The Hypersonic Missiles singer has set up a profile on the app, following in the footsteps of Niall Horan, Jack Whitehall and Channing Tatum, who have all previously used it.</p><p>Sam has attached the Dijon song Many Times on his profile and calls himself a songwriter and musician based in London.</p><p>And the Geordie acknowledges his rock star status, including a snap of his Rolling Stone mag cover on his account, plus a selfie with a bulldog.</p><p>But settling down with someone could be tricky after the singer recently announced a headline Australian tour in November, following the success of his second studio album Seventeen Going Under.</p><p>Last night he closed Portsmouth’s Victorious Festival alongside Anne-Marie and Nothing But Thieves and will now hit Chicago to support Florence And The Machine’s US tour.</p><p>Sam was first tipped for success when he won the 2019 Brits Critics’ Choice award.</p><p>This year he won an Ivor Novello award for Best Song Musically And Lyrically with Seventeen Going Under. Let’s hope he can do just as well in love.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>ELT & BRIT HIT REMIX</h2><p>SHE has only just released Hold Me Closer, her long-awaited comeback single with Elton John, but Britney Spears isn’t resting on her laurels.</p><p>I understand an extended version of the track is set for release, as well as a bumper remix package.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000755793919.jpg><p>Label bosses hope it will give the track longevity, like Elton’s 2021 global smash with Dua Lipa, Cold Heart.</p><p>A source said: “Hold Me Closer has got off to a near- perfect start but now it’s about longevity. Due to streaming, songs can stay on charts for months or simply drop off after the initial buzz dies down.</p><p>“A few remixes and an extended version will help to combat that.” While it’s already topped Spotify and Apple Music charts worldwide, Hold Me Closer will have to fend off a boost in streaming numbers from performers at last night’s MTV VMAs – with Lizzo, Blackpink and Nicki Minaj all having chart singles.</p><p>I first told of the song – a mix of Elton’s 1971 hit Tiny Dancer and 1992 album track The One – at the start of the month.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>Since then Elton has said he hopes the collaboration will finally give Britney the confidence she desperately needs after more than a decade of being locked in her conservatorship.</p><p>I have a feeling it will not only do that, but will also give Britney her highest-charting hit in years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhpaWuBcoSTbWaampKWeqbE056lnaGenHqzsdKim56mk658</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fabba-extending-residency.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fabba-extending-residency.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fabba-extending-residency.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fabba-extending-residency.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fabba-extending-residency.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fabba-extending-residency.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./rocco-b-commisso.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./rocco-b-commisso.html>Fame | Rocco B.
