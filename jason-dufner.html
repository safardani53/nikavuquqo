But from what we know, Jason started playing golf in high school.</p><p>For his high school education, Dufner went to St. Thomas Aquinas and played golf throughout his sophomore, junior, and senior years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jason-Dufner.jpg><p>After his high school graduation, Jason went to Auburn University, where he won an Honorable Mention All-American in 1997.

He was born on March 24, 1977, and under the zodiac sign of Aries.</p><p>Most individuals with this sign are known to be fierce, confident, and leaders.

Not to mention, he has got a pair of dark brown eyes and short brown hair.</p><h2>Professional Career</h2><p>We know that Jason Dufner started playing golf at a young age, but Jason struggled to hold his place on the PGA Tour in his early days.</p><p>He became a member of the PGA Tour in 2004 and even participated in the Nationwide Tour for five consecutive years from 2001-2006.&nbsp;</p><p>During his time on the Nationwide Tour, he won two events, the Buy.com Wichita Open in 2001 and the LaSalle Bank Open in 2006.</p><p>Likewise, he started the 2010 season with no success, recording only two top-10 finishes. But Jason ended the year with a major championship at the 2010 PGA Championship at Whistling Straits.</p><p>In early 2011, Jason had the chance to win his first PGA Tour title at the Waste Management Phoenix Open at TPC Scottsdale. Even though he managed a tie for the lead at 18-under-par after 72 holes, Jason lost the game to Mark Wilson.</p><p>Not to mention, he finished third in the Zurich Classic of New Orleans. Luckily, after Anders Hansen withdrew from the game, Jason earned himself an entry into the 2011 US Open.&nbsp;</p><h3>PGA Championship 2011</h3><p>In 2011, Jason was on his way to winning his first major and maiden PGA Tour title. After long hours of missing and putt, the young Dufner won the title and prize money of $865k.</p><p>After this, Dufner rose to 38th in the Official World Gold Ranking (OWGR). Dufner continued his excellent form the following year, but it soon faded on the weekend.</p><p>That year, Jason won for the first time on the PGA Tour after defeating Ernie Els.

Similarly, on June 4, 2017, the skilled golfer won the Memorial Tournament.</p><h3>Dufnering & Dispute</h3><p>If you ask a golf fan about Jason, you will find that he is often associated with the word “Dufnering.” This term refers to sitting down with the legs straight and the head slumped, which can be often seen in Jason.</p><p>The term originated in March 2013 after a photo of him slumping went viral. He was visiting a youth center in Irving, Texas; during that time, his teammates were quick to mock the golfer with the nickname “Dufnering.”</p><p>Soon the term became popular on Twitter. Jason even got into a Twitter dispute with Golf Channel analyst Brandel Chamblee on November 2017.&nbsp;</p><p>The conflict started after Chamblee reportedly offended Dufner’s swing coach, Chuch Cook. As a result, Chamblee ended up blocking the major champion due to his use of profanities.&nbsp;</p><h2>Career Stats</h2><table><tbody readability=1><tr><td><strong>PGA Tour</strong></td><td><strong>Career Victories</strong></td><td><strong>Career Records</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Best Year Wins: 2</strong></td><td>2nd Place Finishes: 6</td><td>Events Played: 410</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Career Wins: 5</strong></td><td>3rd Place Finishes:2</td><td>Cuts Made: 266</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Top 10 Finishes: 47</td><td>Total Money Earned: 27 million</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Net Worth & Income</h2><p>Jason Dufner is an American professional golfer who has been active since 2004.
