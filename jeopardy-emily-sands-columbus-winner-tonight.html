Columbus thought he was in the Indian Ocean, but it was the Caribbean. It was bad geography that made his voyages a success."</p><p>Emily dropped just $1,601 to advance to the semifinals with $23,599, looking absolutely thrilled to win.</p><h2>'I GAVE KEN A HARD TIME AFTER THE SHOW'</h2><p>Emily took to a&nbsp;<a href=#>Reddit</a>&nbsp;forum to describe her experience and shared she was not thrilled, however, with the Final question.</p><p>She explained on her wager: "Final Jeopardy: I didn't quite have the runaway, so I wagered to cover Carlos going all-in.</p><p>She continued: "I was surprised none of us got this clue, and I even gave Ken a hard time after the show.</p><p>'You couldn't even give us a year?'" she recalled telling him.</p><p>"He said that would make it too easy (which is probably true)."</p><p>Emily added other tidbits about the game: "'She Blinded Me with Science' $800 clue - Ken had to re-record this clue as he was deemed too chipper reading about cancer."</p><p>And: "There was a little discussion at the beginning of the Double Jeopardy! round - as Carlos and I were tied, <a href=#>the first selection</a> went to Carlos as the last one to have responded correctly."</p><p>She concluded: “Big props to Carlos and Phillip for making it a fun game.</p><p>"I recall at one point turning to Phillip and agreeing that it had been a pretty good game with only 1 triple-stumper in the Jeopardy round.”</p><p>Some fans agreed the clue was vague, as one wrote: "I was surprised about Final Jeopardy too, I actually did get that one right.</p><p>"I can understand it seeming a bit too obvious of a choice for some people though, or thinking of explorers who actually did reach Asia. Regardless, you were&nbsp;fantastic&nbsp;today."</p><p>A second fan wrote: "I'm puzzled about FJ, specifically the category title.</p><p>"To whom would&nbsp;Christopher Columbus&nbsp;be writing a letter and, more importantly, who would deliver it?</p><p>"I briefly considered Magellan but remembered he died before completing his voyage, so I settled on Marco Polo. I figured there was already commerce between Europe and China, so he could give his letter to someone returning to Italy."</p><p>However, a third knocked: "Amazingly, everyone was incorrect on FJ."</p><p>A fourth wrote: "All three players were so good today, which makes it all the more impressive Emily nearly locked it up. So many great players in this tournament so far, I’m excited to see how it plays out!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/announced-full-schedule-lineup-brand-853465772-3.jpg><h2>WHAT IS: CHAMPIONS WILDCARD?</h2><p>Jeopardy!'s 40th season&nbsp;<a href=#>premiered</a>&nbsp;on September 11 and runs until late July 2024.</p><p>Champions Wildcard has invited back a massive 108 past players (including the three winners of the <a href=#>Season 37 Second Chance Tournament</a>, which kicked off Season 40) and is a brand new tournament.</p><p>Each leg of the special will feature 27 contestants, with nine quarterfinals, three semifinals, and a two-part final where one winner will emerge.</p><p>Then, the slate is wiped clean, with each leg running for three weeks.</p><p>There will be four winners by the time Champions Wildcard ends on December 18.</p><p>The purse is four&nbsp;<a href=#>$100,000</a>&nbsp;prizes and a slot in the&nbsp;<a href=#>2023 Tournament of Champions</a>.</p><p>Contestant&nbsp;<a href=#>Josh Saak</a>&nbsp;became the first of four winners last week, and the event is now in its second group of quarterfinalists.</p><p>The 2023&nbsp;<a href=#>Tournament of Champions</a>, where last season's stars like&nbsp;<a href=#>Cris Pannullo</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Hannah Wilson</a>&nbsp;await, begins on December 19.</p><h2>WHERE IS: MAYIM BIALIK?</h2><p>Fans may want to know when Ken's counterpart,&nbsp;<a href=#>Mayim Bialik</a>, 47, will be back.</p><p><a href=#>Ken</a>&nbsp;is hosting almost the entire season solo, and&nbsp;Mayim&nbsp;is not involved as it stands.</p><p>She bowed out as a member of Saf-Aftra, a big shakeup since she and Ken were tapped to split hosting in 2022 after&nbsp;<a href=#>Alex Trebek</a>'s tragic&nbsp;death.</p><p>"It’s not for me to personally judge anyone else’s decision [but] I am a union supporter," Mayim told Vanity Fair last month in her&nbsp;<a href=#>first public statement.</a></p><p>"There’s a lot of complexity to this, but my general statement is always that I come from a union family."</p><p>The actress has<a href=#> only been featured once</a> on the <a href=#>game show's</a> social media since July [seen below].</p><p>Mayim's absence has also put a more overarching issue into the forefront:&nbsp;<a href=#>many fans prefer Ken alone as the host.</a></p><p>"[Mayim] is unwatchable with none of the personality that Ken brings to the show," a fan recently wrote on&nbsp;<a href=#>X</a>.</p><p>"Love Ken Jennings, I Hope & He The Only Host Going Forward!" another post read.</p><p>A third recently posted: "It Takes More Than Being Smart To Host Jeopardy. The Powers That Be Should Announce They Were Mistaken To Hire Hollyweird To Host Jeopardy."</p><p>Mayim's return date to the show is still unknown, but it will likely not be until April when new contestants resume.</p><h2>WHEN WILL: 'NORMAL' EPISODES BE BACK?</h2><p>Jeopardy! redid its schedule when deciding to continue despite Hollywood's Strikes (and<a href=#>&nbsp;a lot of backlash</a>).</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>game show</a>&nbsp;threw in placeholder tournaments, not knowing how long the strikes would be.</p><p>Since <a href=#>Season 40</a>&nbsp;premiered last month, Jeopardy! has been pulling contestants from past seasons and using old clues and clues that were previously written but never aired.</p><p>This was a way around the WGA strike since Jeopardy! was without its writers; the WGA strike was resolved last month and the writers have since returned.</p><p>Showrunner&nbsp;<a href=#>Michael Davies</a>&nbsp;defended on the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Inside Jeopardy!” podcast</a>&nbsp;that it “wouldn’t be fair to have new contestants making their first appearance” on the show with material that isn’t original or that was written pre-strike.</p><p>"The material that we’re gonna be using is a combination of material that our WGA writers wrote before the strike, which is still in the database and material that is being redeployed from multiple, multiple seasons of the show.”</p><p>But as a result, past player tournaments have ensued, with all regular programming being pushed aside for quite some time.</p><p>This 2023 ToC will be longer than in years past and feature its own Second Chance competition, another Champions Wildcard, and finally, the actual ToC.</p><p>So, there will be little room for new contestants or&nbsp;"normal episodes"&nbsp;this season.</p><p>Execs explained the&nbsp;<a href=#>overhauled timeline</a>&nbsp;on the podcast, admitting tournament play is the "Number one priority" and "We will have 16 weeks of regular episodes at the end of the year."</p><p>That means we won't see new contestants until April, with just four months of regular play this year out of 11 months.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Not all fans are sold on the big change, as one recently vented: "I am sick of the current tournaments. BRING BACK REGULAR PLAY, PLEASE!"</p><p>"Oh my god, is it really until April? That's absolutely wild," wrote another.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/s-mayim-bialik-breaks-silence-831338890-15.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/host-official-poster-fans-say-841061689-12.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/fans-remember-mayim-bialik-co-854257020-2.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxZGaEdH2QaKGep6CWv6XFjJ6koqSpYsCiusOsZJynnKq6o8HSZq6ipp6av27AzqegoKCkZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjeopardy-emily-sands-columbus-winner-tonight.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjeopardy-emily-sands-columbus-winner-tonight.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjeopardy-emily-sands-columbus-winner-tonight.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjeopardy-emily-sands-columbus-winner-tonight.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjeopardy-emily-sands-columbus-winner-tonight.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjeopardy-emily-sands-columbus-winner-tonight.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./john-e-sununu.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./john-e-sununu.html>John E.
