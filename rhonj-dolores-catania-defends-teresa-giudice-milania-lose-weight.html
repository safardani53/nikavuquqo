Milania explained, "My mom would be like - she would never say anything - but she would be like, 'Oh, you're going to have another ice cream?'"</p><p>Before her pre-teen weight loss, Milania admitted she weighed 150 pounds and dropped down to about 110 after her diet.</p><p>Now, Teresa's castmate and best friend <a href=#>Dolores</a>, 52, is coming to the podcast host's defense after fans "mom-shamed" <a href=#>Teresa</a>, 51, on social media.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on RHONJ">Read More on RHONJ</h2><p>"I do remember Milania had gone through something and she was gaining weight," Dolores recalled while chatting with The U.S. Sun at a party celebrating her BELLA Around Town magazine cover.</p><p>She continued: "You know what? Sometimes as an adolescent, you get into an unhealthy lifestyle- you're eating junk with your friends all the time."</p><p>"I think it's good for a mom to monitor and to be conscious of their child's weight and to get on them about it before it gets out of hand. Obesity is very unhealthy."</p><p>In the podcast, Milania remembered: "I was way thicker in middle school. I was a pumpkin.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>"One day it hit me, and I felt suffocated in my own body."</p><h2>HAPPY IN HER SKIN</h2><p>Dolores shared an update on her own health journey in the interview with The U.S. Sun, which took place at Avenue in Pier Village in Long Branch, <a href=#>New Jersey</a> on July 12.</p><p>The <a href=#>RHONJ</a> star <a href=#>revealed her drastic weight loss</a> during an appearance on <a href=#>Watch What Happens Live</a> in April where she admitted to starting Mounjaro- similar to Ozempic- which she had been on for six weeks at the time.</p><p>"You know, everyone's losing so much weight [on it]," she told The U.S. Sun.</p><p>"It's questionable - what are the repercussions of this when everyone's done? Is there side effects?</p><p>"All the doctors that I spoke to said 'no.'"</p><p>The TV personality went on to explain that prior to taking Mounjaro, which was prescribed by her doctor, she had "been on Ozempic for two years."</p><p>The Bravolebrity confessed: "I stopped taking it because it was expensive and everything.</p><p>"But being healthy and living a healthy lifestyle is cheap - it's free!"</p><p>She then clarified her interview on WWHL with <a href=#>Andy Cohen</a> when she said she had just started Mounjaro.</p><p>"I took Ozempic, stopped and then begun Mounjaro. I was medically prescribed for both because I am insulin resistance/pre-diabetic and have a thyroid issue," Dolores told The U.S. Sun.</p><p>"I work out regularly. There is no easy fix for weight loss and I have to watch what I eat."</p><h2>NEXT STEPS</h2><p>The mom of two attended the BELLA Magazine event with her boyfriend, <a href=#>Paul Connell</a>, of nearly two years.</p><p>When asked for a relationship update, Dolores dished: "Things are going really good. He's been able to handle all this [fame] a lot better than most would. He has fun with it."</p><p>During season 13 of RHONJ, Paul revealed he had already bought her an engagement ring after Dolores' ex, <a href=#>Frank Catania</a>, pried.</p><p>However, Dolores laughed and said that he was just "busting his chops."</p><p>A proposal has yet to happen, and she's totally okay with it.</p><p>"I mean, I always said marriage isn't my goal in a relationship. Peace is a goal. Peace and growing together.</p><p>"I've lived my life. I've had my kids, I've been married. I've been divorced for 25 years," she explained.</p><p>"You know, I don't shun marriage, but it's not like I have to be married."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The couple is also holding off on buying a new home together - which they teased during the <a href=#>reunion</a> - since "economy-wise" it's not the right time.</p><p>For now, Dolores has moved into Paul's <a href=#>stunning $2million Edgewater townhouse</a> and still has her family home in North Haledon, which she has lived in for over 25 years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/rhonj-star-dolores-catania-attending-831562501.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/2023-appeared-latest-issue-pictured-831564979.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwZW6Bd4CSaKmhp56feqW7y6ipnqtdmK61rc2imGaclZuyr7DSZqueqpWorm6zyK6bopuVYrqquMCnoJplnKTApnnWnqCgoKRk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frhonj-dolores-catania-defends-teresa-giudice-milania-lose-weight.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2frhonj-dolores-catania-defends-teresa-giudice-milania-lose-weight.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2frhonj-dolores-catania-defends-teresa-giudice-milania-lose-weight.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2frhonj-dolores-catania-defends-teresa-giudice-milania-lose-weight.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frhonj-dolores-catania-defends-teresa-giudice-milania-lose-weight.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2frhonj-dolores-catania-defends-teresa-giudice-milania-lose-weight.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./robbie-kays-girlfriend-list.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./robbie-kays-girlfriend-list.html>Who is Robbie Kay Dating Robbie Kay's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./smokey-robinson-health.html>Motown Singer Recalls COVID-19 Fight</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./smokey-robinson-health.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
