<time>05 Oct 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong><a href=#>Bristol Palin</a></strong> took to <a href=#>her blog</a> on Wednesday, Oct. 22, to share her side of the infamous birthday party brawl that took place at an Anchorage birthday party last month.</p><p>“Most of the time, I let the lies pass,” wrote Bristol, 24. “After all, the truth eventually comes out. But when people are selling ‘scoop,’ photos, and false information…sometimes the truth just isn’t as profitable… That’s why, after a month and a half of hearing rumors about myself and family, I’ve finally decided to comment about the situation. Instead of listening to all the people who weren’t there—people who claim they heard this from their cousin/brother/sister-in-law/step-daughter/long lost little brother–let me tell you what actually happened.”</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=658 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="bristol palin brawl front view" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Palin’s perspective on the incident included some disparities from party host <strong>Korey Klingenmeyer</strong>‘s point of view in the police report released Oct. 9. “Our friend got knocked out from a cheap shot from behind. (His injury resulted in ten stitches, so it was really low),” she wrote. (<a href=#>In the police report</a>, Bristol’s father <strong>Todd Palin </strong>said that the friend, <strong>Steven</strong>, was attacked and knocked to the ground, making it “a situation they couldn’t walk away from.”)</p><p>“When Willow saw all this happening she looked at the guy’s mom and said ‘get ahold of your son,'” Bristol wrote. “But apparently the apple didn’t fall too far from the tree, because his mom pushed <strong>Willow</strong>. A grown woman pushed my little sister.”</p><p>By then, Bristol was already in her family’s limo parked in the driveway of Klingenmeyer’s home. “But when Willow ran to me crying, telling me that some lady had pushed her down, I got out of the car to go talk to her. Any big sister would do this,” she recalled, adding that “next to God, family is the most important thing to me.”</p><p>What happened after was even more terrifying for the Dancing With the Stars alum, who claimed Klingenmeyer physically accosted her in his pursuit of fame. “After I got out of the car, I didn’t get far,” the eldest Palin daughter revealed. “I never even got to talk to his mom, because a guy in his late thirties or early forties got in my face. He was towering over me—probably at 6 foot something and over 200 pounds. He puffed his chest out and started yelling. ‘You c—!’ he looked right in my eyes and said. ‘Get the f— out of here, you slut!’ I was alarmed that things had gotten so bad so fast. But it got even worse when this guy started pushing me. He had his hands on me, pushing me down. That’s when I swung and hit his face.”</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=437 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="bristol palin brawl back view" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>In the police report, Klingenmeyer claimed that Bristol had punched him five or six times after that initial hit. “He says she gets up and tries to punch him again and he grabs her fist again and pushes her away and she falls down again,” the report read. Bristol, though, said that initial punch was the only one she threw.</p><p>“It was scary and awful. He held me down until someone got me out of the situation. That’s it – that’s the story,” she wrote. “I didn’t ‘swing and hit him seven times with a strong right hook’ as so many so-called news stories have reported. After this incident, I still had a perfect manicure on all ten of my nails.”</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=365 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="bristol palin brawl hands" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><a href=#>According to the police report</a>, there was a “strong odor of alcohol coming from the group” when officers John Daily and Justin Blake arrived on the scene. Bristol’s 25-year-old brother<strong> Track</strong> “appeared heavily intoxicated and acted belligerent at first” as he was without his shirt and bloodied “around his mouth and on his hands,” the report read. Former GOP Vice Presidential candidate <strong>Sarah</strong> and<strong> Todd Palin</strong> both “appeared upset and in a verbal argument with other individuals at the scene,” while Willow was described as “extremely agitated.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Weeks after the Sept. 6 incident, former Alaska governor Sarah took to her Facebook to defend her children. “I love my Bristol! My straight-shooter is one of the strongest young women you’ll ever meet,” she wrote. “I have to say this as a proud mama: right up there with their work ethic and heart for those less fortunate, my kids’ defense of family makes my heart soar!”</p><p>Still, Bristol was upset by the public’s response to the brawl. “In the meantime, I was pushed and held down by some guy,” she wrote. “Here’s the thing. Violence against women is never okay… Even if that violence occurs against conservative women. Imagine for a second the outrage that would happen if Chelsea Clinton had gotten pushed by some guy. Had she tried to defend herself, the liberal media would’ve held her up as some feminist hero.” <a href=#>See Bristol’s most controversial moments over the years</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabqpmowbC4jKmYpaGeYq%2Btu8asZJqan6rBbrLApqClsV2Xv6LDy2aumqtdmK6tuMSdZJplk2Kur7CMrKOurF1nfXKAkWxoaWc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbristol-palin-blogs-about-family-brawl-was-called-a-c-and-slut-20142310.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbristol-palin-blogs-about-family-brawl-was-called-a-c-and-slut-20142310.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbristol-palin-blogs-about-family-brawl-was-called-a-c-and-slut-20142310.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbristol-palin-blogs-about-family-brawl-was-called-a-c-and-slut-20142310.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbristol-palin-blogs-about-family-brawl-was-called-a-c-and-slut-20142310.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbristol-palin-blogs-about-family-brawl-was-called-a-c-and-slut-20142310.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./declan-rice-qatar-suitcase-world-cup.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./declan-rice-qatar-suitcase-world-cup.html>Declan Rice admits he's taking EMPTY suitcase to Qatar with England star determined to bring World C</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./antiques-roadshow-expert-gobsmacked-royal-treasures-worth.html>Antiques Roadshow expert 'gobsmacked' by guest's 'next level' royal treasures worth more than a hous</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./antiques-roadshow-expert-gobsmacked-royal-treasures-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
