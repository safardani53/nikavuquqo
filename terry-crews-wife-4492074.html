Now, he’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>hosting America’s Got Talent</a>&nbsp;and developing a new sitcom, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Tonight</a>. Terry’s wife,<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> <strong>Rebecca King-Crews</strong></a>, 56, has been by his side through richer or poorer — but it wasn’t always easy.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The couple tied the knot in 1989, and 32 years later, they’re still together and are the proud parents of five beautiful children. Some of the rough points in their marriage were caused by Terry’s infidelity and porn addiction, and Rebecca’s bought with cancer. Still, Terry and Rebecca have managed to survive it all while continuing to being honest about the obstacles they’ve faced together. “He’s the hero of our story, in my opinion,” Rebecca told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;PEOPLE </a>in March 2021. “He made the choice to take this battle on and really become a better person.” Below, learn everything you need to know about Rebecca King-Crews and her marriage to Terry.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/terry-crews-with-wife-rebecca-crews-shutterstock-embed.jpg><h2>How Did Terry & Rebecca Meet?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Terry and Rebecca met in college during the ’80s. At the time, Terry was a football player at Western Michigan University, which Rebecca was a student pursuing her music and theater career, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Heavy</a>. And while the two ultimately ended up together, their initial interactions were far from romantic.&nbsp;“He almost got stuck in the friend zone. He was a little&nbsp;too&nbsp;nice,” Rebecca told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>E! News</a>&nbsp;in 2018. Terry agreed, telling the publication, “I had to earn it.” Earned it he did, and the pair have been together ever since.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Terry and Rebecca said “I do” on July 29, 1989. Not much is known about the wedding ceremony, but their time as a family of two didn’t last long, as their daughter <strong>Azriel&nbsp;</strong>was born less than a year after the nuptials. A year after that, Terry was drafted into the NFL by the Los Angeles Rams. Talk about a wild first two years of marriage!</p><h2>Rebecca Is A Designer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/terry-crews-with-wife-rebecca-crews-shutterstock-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Thirty years into their marriage, Rebecca Crews was inspired to start her own clothing line after she had trouble finding an all-white pantsuit. “I scoured Los Angeles and even Beverly Hills, and had to piece together an outfit from three different designers (holding them closely to the light to make sure the whites were the same tone),” she recalled on her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>website</a>. “I chose my shoes and accessories. I had my ‘white tux’ – but it was less than I had envisioned, and it would have to do.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“That day I was resolute …. I needed to start making my own apparel,” she remembered. “I commissioned my designer friend to create six suits to my specifications that could be worn formally or informally.” Her suits ended up being worn to some of Hollywood’s biggest events, including the Golden Globes, the Night Before The Emmy’s Party, and more. “Everywhere I went, I was asked by my various celebrity friends ‘WHERE did you get that SUIT?!'” Rebecca continued. “I coyly replied, ‘This is my collection.’ And a dream was born.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Rebecca launched Rebecca Crews LLC and never looked back. Her brand now includes purses, shoes, accessories, and more.</p><h2>Rebecca Prays For Her Followers and Shares Motivational Quotes</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>It would make sense for Rebecca to share her latest designs with her nearly 90,000 followers on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>, but instead, she tries to use her platform for the greater good. Her feed is full of motivational quotes and inspirational speeches. For instance, her May 24, 2023 photo reads, “Once you face your fear, nothing is ever as hard as you think.” She continued the positivity in her caption.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>“Today, I challenge you to confront your fears head-on. Embrace your courage, step into the unknown, and watch your limitations crumble like dust,” she penned. “The journey may seem daunting, but remember that within every challenge lies the potential for growth and triumph. The path to greatness is paved with fearless determination and a refusal to let fear hold you back!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>She also has several videos in which she offers a prayer to her followers, as seen above.</p><h2>Rebecca Always Wanted A Big Family</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/terry-crews-with-wife-rebecca-crews-shutterstock-embed5.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-14>Terry and Rebecca are proud parents to five children: <strong>Naomi,&nbsp;</strong><strong>Azriel</strong>, <strong>Tera</strong>, <strong>Wynfrey</strong>, and <strong>Isaiah</strong>. The entire family was featured on the BET reality series The Family Crews, which ran for two seasons from 2010 to 2011. The episodes featured hilarious moments between the seven-person Crews clan.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>Terry has absolutely loved having a large family. In fact, the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>America’s Got Talent</a>&nbsp;host even said in 2016 that he would love to welcome a sixth child via adoption.&nbsp;“I keep saying, ‘We’ve got to wait until we’re ready,’ but we weren’t ready for our own kids. It’s weird. You’re never ready … Literally, one day we’re just going to have to do it!” Terry told <a class=body-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/terry-crews-of-brooklyn-nine-nine-wants-to-adopt-w166935/ data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Us Weekly</a>. Meanwhile, Rebecca said, “It’s something we discussed back when we were first married. It was something that I always felt kind of called to do. I would see ads in magazines, and I would just stare at them like, ‘I’m going to do that one day.’ ”</p><h2>Terry & Rebecca Have Had A Few Rough Patches</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/terry-crews-with-wife-rebecca-crews-shutterstock-embed4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-16>Three decades of marriage has not been easy for Terry and Rebecca. They’ve weathered many storms together, most notably Terry’s infidelity. In 2010, Terry called Rebecca from New York City and admitted he had cheated on her. He also confessed to having a porn addiction. In Terry’s 2021 audio memoir Stronger Together, Rebecca admitted she had a feeling Terry may be cheating. “These odd little sayings were coming to me, like, ‘You’re going to have a new marriage,’ ” she said, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>The couple referred to that day as “D-Day,” and it nearly destroyed their marriage. Rebecca threatened to leave Terry, but he promised to attend therapy and rehab and repair his mistakes. Terry did just that, and against all odds, he and Rebecca stayed together. He later showed his full support for Rebecca when she was diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer in 2020. She underwent a double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery, and Terry was there for her every step of the way. “I tease him all the time — I’m like, did I have to get cancer to be treated like this?!'” Rebecca told PEOPLE.</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>Through all the ups and downs, Terry and Rebecca have come out stronger than ever. The couple has been completely transparent about their struggles, but they’ve also acknowledged how they’re in probably a better place together than ever before. “I watched my husband transform — I have the softer, gentler, kinder Terry now,” Rebecca said to PEOPLE. “I’m thankful because our story could have gone another way, had he not decided that we were worth fighting for.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9OeqauxXZi%2FpsPSZq6inpVigXWFkWlubWc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fterry-crews-wife-4492074.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fterry-crews-wife-4492074.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fterry-crews-wife-4492074.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fterry-crews-wife-4492074.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fterry-crews-wife-4492074.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fterry-crews-wife-4492074.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./lori-harvey-damson-idris-dinner-date-los-angeles-photos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./lori-harvey-damson-idris-dinner-date-los-angeles-photos.html>Lori Harvey &amp;amp; Damson Idris Have Dinner Date In Los Angeles: Photos Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./theres-a-pretty-crazy-story-behind-jennifer-hudsons-oscars-manicure.html>Jennifer Hudson Oscars 2013 Manicure</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./theres-a-pretty-crazy-story-behind-jennifer-hudsons-oscars-manicure.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
