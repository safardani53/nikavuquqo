He led his team to take over Kentucky at the Champions Classic, averaging 6 points, 4 rebounds, and 7 assists in a &nbsp;118–84 win.</p><p>Jones again held his team to a 69–58 triumph over Texas Tech, chipping 13 points, 5 rebounds, 5 assists, and 6 steals.</p><p></p><p>Unluckily, Jones was troubled with a shoulder injury on January 14, 2019, when he was put on a clash with Frank Howard of Syracuse. His situation got miserable, and he had to miss two games in the season.</p><p>Jones made a comeback on January 26, when he was placed against&nbsp; Georgia Tech. Overall, he scored&nbsp; 9.4 points for the freshman season, 5.3 assists, and 3.8 rebounds per game in 36 games for the Duke Blue Devils.</p><h3>Sophomore year (2019-2020)</h3><p>The Dukes declared Jones’s return for the 2019-20 season on April 8, 2019. He averaged 15 points in his first match of the sophomore season, a 68-66 win over Kansas.</p><p>He proved himself again by notching 31 points in a 74-63 victory over Georgia State, which was also a highlighted part of his career.

And, he scored more than 30 points in Duke history.</p><p>Luck did not favor him again, and Jones had to miss out on the games against Wofford and Brown. This was due to his not-so-severe foot injury in late December.</p><p>On average, Jones scored 16.2 points, 6.4 assists, 4.2 rebounds, and 1.8 steals per game as a sophomore. As a consequence of his laudable playing style, he was named ACC Player of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year.</p><p>Jones was titled second-team All-American by USA Today. Similarly, he was named third-team All-American by the Associated Press, Sports Illustrated, and CBS Sports.</p><p>Moreover, it came out as no surprise when he got voted to the USBWA District III All-District Team. He stood a finalist for the Naismith Defensive Player of the Year.</p><h3>National Team Career</h3><p>He played at the &nbsp;2015 FIBA Americas Under-16 Championship in Argentina for the United States, coming to his national team career.&nbsp;</p><p>And led his team to win the gold medal recording 19 steals in the competition.

The duo has been together for a while now. In fact, the duo has a lovely family and also shares a baby daughter, named Zara.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Instagram-post-of-Jones-586x1024.jpg><p>Initially, Jones made it clear that he is not single through his Instagram post.

As Tre is the younger one, he is always followed up by asking, ” How does your game compare to your brother’s?”</p><p>Jones answered, “I just admire him for the person he is,” Jones stated. “He’s really humble. He thinks about others before himself. He’s just a perfect guy and an extremely hard worker.</p><p>That’s what has gotten him to everything he’s achieved in life. Those things are what stood out to me and are what made me want to be like him.”</p><h3>His mother – Debbie, has breast cancer.</h3><p>Jones is a very cheerful, optimistic, and strong guy. He does not like to share his private affairs much, but this time, it was about his mother.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Wth-his-mother-300x284.png><p>Through an Instagram post, he shared that his mother, Debbie, was diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer.
