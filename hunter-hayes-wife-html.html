In recent years, the singer has openly stated on multiple occasions that he had been single for a long time, and he was "pathetically always looking" for a life partner.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Is Hunter Hayes Married to a Wife Now?</h2><p>Things do not seem to have changed for Hayes, as he allegedly is still single at the moment. He has not been reported on getting married to a wife or being engaged in a relationship with a girlfriend. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In addition, his Instagram handle also gives no hint of a possible partner, even though he represents himself as a romantic man, often playing guitar with beautiful sunsets serving as a backdrop.</p><h2>The Singer Previously Dated Libby Barnes</h2><p>Hayes was previously in a longtime relationship with his ex-girlfriend&nbsp;Libby Barnes, a Nashville native who previously worked as a hairstylist and makeup artist.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>He started dating her in 2014 and even&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">introduced her</a> to his fans as she accompanied him to the 2014 CMA Awards. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Speaking with People in 2017, the&nbsp;country music artist stated that&nbsp;his “heart was happy,” with Barnes but he had&nbsp;no intention of rushing into a proposal.</p><p>"I think everybody has their own schedule," he added. "Rush is never a good word for anything, but I know my heart’s happy, and I hope she’s as happy as I am."</p><p>But despite the relationship looking promising, the two reportedly split in 2018, after 4 years of dating. He subsequently released a&nbsp;post-breakup single 'Heartbreak,' which was his&nbsp;first single&nbsp;in nearly three years. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Music Helped Him Get Over His Breakup</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In another <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with People</a> post-breakup in August 2018,&nbsp;Hayes revealed that he was still a&nbsp;hopeless romantic who would "never stop trying to find his other half."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>He continued to say,</p><p>I’m pathetically always looking for my life partner, there’s no question. It’s a bit overly romantic I think, [but] I am. I do love that partnership and team effort and a lot of creativity has been born from those experiences.</p><p>He added that he was not letting himself down because of a breakup and that his music was apparently helping him keep his morale high. He even said that he wanted to release more albums and songs in the future. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Hunter Hayes' Ideal Partner</h2><p>But what is Haynes looking for in his partner now? During an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with ET Online</a> in 2020, he revealed that he was still single during the quarantine period and was looking for an ideal partner. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>Explaining his ideal partner, he said he was looking for someone who could inspire him and let him help them pursue their dreams, too. He also said that he wanted a partner with whom he could talk about life and things around it.</p><p>The singer also clarified that he was not necessarily seeking someone from within the industry, stating he once thought it was a good idea to date someone from the industry, but his views changed with time.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>When the interviewer asked him to point out three things he wanted in his partner, he answered by saying that his partner needed to have a good sense of humor, a positive outlook towards life, and have a sense of adventure.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKClo8GmvoyhmLKdo2LEqrLEZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhunter-hayes-wife-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhunter-hayes-wife-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhunter-hayes-wife-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhunter-hayes-wife-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhunter-hayes-wife-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhunter-hayes-wife-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jennifer-aniston-denies-eating-viral-friends-salad.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jennifer-aniston-denies-eating-viral-friends-salad.html>Jennifer Aniston Denies Eating Viral 'Friends' Salad</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./bailee-madison-boyfriend-html.html>Bailee Madison and Boyfriend Blake Richardsons Complete Dating Timeline</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./bailee-madison-boyfriend-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
