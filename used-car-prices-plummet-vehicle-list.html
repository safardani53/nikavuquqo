SEAT Ateca diesel</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/vehicle-list-778433790.jpg><p>Like its twin the <a href=#>Skoda</a> Karoq, SEAT's second entry on the list has been hit by the big diesel decline.</p><p>By comparison, the Skoda has done well, with the Ateca seeing a 16.3% decline from £19,694 to £16,482.</p><h2>7. Hyundai Tucson diesel</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/vehicle-list-778433891.jpg><p>The Tucson is has seen older models drop in price quite sharply.</p><p>This may be due to the fact that a new model entered the market this year and hasn't made it to second-hand dealerships yet.</p><p>It has seen a whopping 18.8% decline in its example price, from £18,558 to £15,097.</p><h2>6. Nissan X-Trail diesel</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/vehicle-list-778433892.jpg><p>The X-Trail has seen price falls for both its diesel and petrol versions in the past year, with the diesel again seeing the bigger drop.</p><p>Drivers might be forgiven for feeling a bit out of place in the chunky off roader as they cruise down the motorway.</p><p>The price has seen a 18.9% drop from £21,041 to £17,066.</p><h2>5. Ford Kuga diesel</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/vehicle-list-778433941.jpg><p>Another diesel model hurt by the arrival of a more recent updated model, the Kuga was a very popular SUV for Brits.</p><p>However, it has been slated as less spacious than rivals like the <a href=#>Kia</a> Sportage and our old friend the Peugeot 3008</p><p>This has seen the example price go from £19,935 to £16,086, a drop of 19.4%</p><h2>4. Jeep Renegade diesel</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/vehicle-list-778434013.jpg><p>This lesser-known SUV shares most of its components with the Fiat 500X and never really took off in Britain.</p><p>The model was discontinued in 2019 and has seen 19.6% of its second-hand value shaved off this year, with the example price dropping from £14,475 to £11,650.</p><h2>3. Range Rover Evoque diesel</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/vehicle-list-778434066.jpg><p>The Evoque has enjoyed quite a lot of popularity since it came on the scene in 2011.</p><p>However, all good things must come to an end, especially when they're diesel-powered it seems, as the price has slumped by a nice round 20%.</p><p>This has seen the value shed £6,000 from £26,204 to £20,971.</p><h2>2. Nissan Qashqai diesel</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/vehicle-list-778434139.jpg><p>More a question of supply than demand, Britain's most bought SUV has seen its previous generations fall victim to the great second-hand diesel price purge.</p><p>First arriving on the market way back in 2013, the Qashqai was much loved by motorists up and down the country.</p><p>It's affordable, nimble, spacious and good fun to drive, but as more and more end up for sale, the price is being held down.</p><p>However, its value has lost around £3,000 off the top, with a 20.6% fall from £15,450 to £12,267.</p><h2>1.
