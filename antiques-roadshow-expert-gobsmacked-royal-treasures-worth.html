<time>05 Oct 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>ANTIQUES Roadshow expert Gordon Foster was left “gobsmacked” by a guest’s collection of family heirlooms which have huge historical and royal significance.&nbsp;</p><p>Sunday’s episode of the popular <a href=#>antiques show</a> took viewers to Pollok Country Park in the Southside of <a href=#>Glasgow</a>. The roadshow showcased a variety of antiques from trinkets celebrating Glasgow’s history to “unbelievable” photographs from <a href=#>WWII</a>, but it was a collection of royal treasures shown at the end of the episode, which made <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gordon</a>’s jaw drop.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-01-08-130235.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-01-08-130342.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-01-08-130313.png><p>The guest brought a silver basin, a silver jug and a glass bottle of centuries-old rosewater which had been in their family for generations. The items had been used for several royal ceremonies and Gordon was gobsmacked when she saw the items, which he later declared to be some of Scotland’s most valuable historic treasures.&nbsp;</p><p>Initially, Gordon valued the collection at between £30,000 to £50,000, but having heard the family history behind the items, he increased his valuation significantly.&nbsp;</p><p>The guest revealed that the items come from an ancestor, who lived in the 1400s on the outskirts of <a href=#>Edinburgh</a> near a place called Cramond Brig.</p><p>They explained: “One evening, he heard a commotion on the bridge and he saw a man on horseback being attacked. So he ran to the bridge and helped fend off the attackers. Took the man into his house and bathed his wound.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON ANTIQUES ROADSHOW">READ MORE ON ANTIQUES ROADSHOW</h2><p>“Long story short, it turned out that he had just saved the life of King James V. And, as a simple farmer, was then gifted land by the King and a condition of that gift was that Jock and his ancestors must be available to the King and his ancestors if ever called upon again at Cramond Brig.</p><p>“If you then fast forward to 1822, Sir Walter Scott knew of the story, and had written about it in Tales of a Grandfather. He arranged for my great-great-great-grandfather, William Houison Craufurd, to do a ceremonial washing of the hands to symbolise the washing of the wounds for George IV and that was carried out in 1822 in Edinburgh.</p><p>“The water in here [the glass bottle] is actually the original rose water from 1822! The silverware is what was used for the ceremony.”</p><p>Expert Gordon was over the moon to learn the history behind the antiques. He replied: “It’s the most incredible story, isn’t it? It really is!”&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Reality</h2></p><p>The guest continued, revealing that the items have been a part of many more ceremonies. “It has been done since then for subsequent monarchs.”&nbsp;</p><p>Expert Gordon then replied: “It was last used for her late Majesty <a href=#>The Queen</a>, presumably?” To which the guest confirmed: “It was, yes, we haven’t asked <a href=#>The King</a> as yet and plan to ask next time he comes to Scotland, next year, possibly.”</p><p>After hearing this incredible story, Gordon proceeded to give the items a jaw-dropped value because of their historical significance.&nbsp;</p><p>He said: “I would regard these, having listened to what you said, as one of Scotland’s treasures. These are extremely important pieces of silver. You’ve got the <a href=#>Royal</a> connection, and you’ve got the continuing Royal tradition that’s going to keep going down the generations. It just takes it into a whole different level of value.”</p><p>Gordon went on: “I don’t want to frighten you too much. I would put a valuation on this of £100,000 to £150,000! It could even be slightly more!”&nbsp;</p><p>The guest was left stunned, although he quipped: “For us, the value is priceless because it’s the only way we can do the service.”</p><p>He added: “It’s not going anywhere!”&nbsp;</p><p>Gordon was thrilled to hear that the tradition would continue, and admitted that he was honoured to get the opportunity to see them in person. “I’m still gobsmacked!” he exclaimed.</p><p><strong>Antiques Roadshow airs on Saturdays at 7pm on <a href=#>BBC</a> One.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGplZ4V1fZBtZpqmpJ6%2BtrHSZqmomZSotbDDjJ6vqZ2iqXqou8GspJqbm5qxbr7OspilZaSnsqK%2F1KucrGWnpL%2B1tI4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fantiques-roadshow-expert-gobsmacked-royal-treasures-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fantiques-roadshow-expert-gobsmacked-royal-treasures-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fantiques-roadshow-expert-gobsmacked-royal-treasures-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fantiques-roadshow-expert-gobsmacked-royal-treasures-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fantiques-roadshow-expert-gobsmacked-royal-treasures-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fantiques-roadshow-expert-gobsmacked-royal-treasures-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bristol-palin-blogs-about-family-brawl-was-called-a-c-and-slut-20142310.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bristol-palin-blogs-about-family-brawl-was-called-a-c-and-slut-20142310.html>Bristol Palin Blogs About Family Brawl: Was Called a &amp;quot;C--- and Slut&amp;quot;</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./leva-bonaparte-net-worth.html>What is Leva Bonaparte's Net Worth?
