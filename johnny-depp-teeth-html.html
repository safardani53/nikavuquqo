<time>01 Jan 0001, 00:00</time></div></div><p><a href=# rel=follow>Johnny Depp</a> is synonymous with Captain Jack Sparrow on the internet and in the minds of anyone who loves the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. Sparrow is also his most iconic and hardly arguably the biggest role of his career. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>But the status Sparrow has in pop culture didn't just come about. It is a meticulously crafted and often experimented-upon character, mostly by Depp himself.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>While Depp was initially picked to play the role because of his edgy nature.&nbsp;Jerry Bruckheimer chose him to break the mold that Disney had their characters fitted into — softness. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Depp, however, did something to his teeth, something that even took Bruckheimer by surprise. So much so that he asked him to tone it down.</p><h2>Johnny Depp Redid His Teeth for Captain Jack Sparrow</h2><p>After being selected for the role of Sparrow, Depp went to work to take the character beyond Disney and Bruckheimer's expectations. He remodeled the character after Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards after reading about the 18th century pirates being akin to rockstars.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Then, in a wild move, he put gold caps on all his front teeth before showing up for the first Pirates movie, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl's&nbsp;shooting. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Depp showed up to the sets with all sparkling front teeth and took Bruckheimer, and the Disney executives present aback.</p><p>"Jerry was slightly uncomfortable," he told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">LA Times</a> in June 2003. "and the Disney executives weren’t exactly enthusiastic about it."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>However, he planned to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">stand his ground</a> with his decisions. "Look, these are the choices I made. You know my work. So either trust me or give me the boot," Depp told the two parties. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>They didn't remove him from the movie, but he did have to make a compromise. He took a few gold caps off his teeth.</p><p>Who knows how Sparrow might have looked if he had a few more gold teeth or none at all? Depp's choices, though, seem perfect for Sparrow.</p><p>Depp is very attached to his characters, especially to Sparrow. And that shows in how he goes about when dealing with them. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Sparrow, especially, has hijacked a few style choices Depp made in the past. As Gore Verbinski, the director of the Pirates movies, put it, "He's always half-Jack." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Johnny Depp with his gold teeth at the Tourist Premiere in Tokyo in 2011.</strong> (Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Wikimedia Commons</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>In 2012, when doing an interview with <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Rolling Stone</a> magazine, he showed up dressed half like a pirate. He had several gold caps on and had clothes braided into his hair.</p><p>"With all of my characters, it’s just depressing to leave them," he told the magazine in November 2012. "With Captain Jack, when we finished shooting the first movie, I had a feeling I’d see him again. I didn’t feel like I was saying goodbye."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>At the time, Depp and Verbinski were filming the third installation of the <a href=# rel=follow>Pirates franchise</a>. And he had kept the gold caps on because the shooting was ongoing and he was tired of removing and putting them back on. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Johnny Depp’s Teeth and Questions about Method Acting, Health, and Habits</h2><p>Depp's tendency to embrace his characters (arguably) a bit too much and let them flow into his real life has made many people uncomfortable over the years. The actor, however, has never really paid attention to the concerns. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Fans have, many times, mentioned Depp's method acting and how he might take&nbsp;it too far at times with the teeth and his characters-like dress up. This concern was most evident after&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">his appearance</a> at the premiere of&nbsp;Black Mass in 2015.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>In that movie, he played a gangster who had stained and overall horrible-looking teeth. He appeared on the red carpet with his ex wife, <a href=# rel=follow>Amber Heard</a>, dressed in gothic all-black outfit with yellow-looking teeth.</p><p>At the time, fans also expressed concerns about how his teeth might have looked that way because of unhealthy habits and lack of hygiene.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Pirates and Black Mass weren't the only times he altered his teeth for a character. He did something similar to fit into the Willy Wonka role in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in 2005.</p><p>He felt it important to dissolve into the visuals Wonka would give off. So, to get the feel for the character's smiling face and positive attitude, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">used veneers</a> to change his teeth's looks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKKfnbuvxYydnKmoXamypsDHZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjohnny-depp-teeth-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjohnny-depp-teeth-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjohnny-depp-teeth-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjohnny-depp-teeth-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjohnny-depp-teeth-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjohnny-depp-teeth-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kate-middleton-university-of-st-andrews-graduation.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kate-middleton-university-of-st-andrews-graduation.html>Kate Middleton: University of St. Andrews Graduation</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jana-kramer-reacts-to-mike-caussin-divorce-settlement-child-support.html>Jana Kramer Reacts to Mike Caussin Divorce Settlement, Child Support</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jana-kramer-reacts-to-mike-caussin-divorce-settlement-child-support.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
