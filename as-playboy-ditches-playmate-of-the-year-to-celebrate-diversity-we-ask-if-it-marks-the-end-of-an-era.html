They’re just giving us more. Playboy Playmates brighten up the world.</p><p>Just look at the last few Playmates Of The Year, as I, plus the now quarterly mag’s half a million subscribers, have done at leisure.</p><p>They are usually women you have never heard of — no naff celebrities pumped full of fillers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000057504330.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000057504340.jpg><p>Dani Mathers, 2015 winner, a vision of blonde sunshine and only 5ft 1in.</p><p>Likewise Sara Jean Underwood, another perfect petite Playmate (2007) at 5ft 3in.</p><p>Hope Dworaczyk. No, I can’t pronounce 2010’s Playmate Of The Year’s name either but I know how to spell it — H O T.</p><p>And what about the ones you have heard of?</p><p>The Playmates who weren’t Playmate Of The Year, mainly because they didn’t need the honour?</p><p>Marilyn Monroe was on the cover of the first issue in 1953, while Daisy Lowe was September 2011’s cover star.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000570158222.jpg><p>Kate Moss’s now iconic shoot in 2014 is the Playboy Bunny to end them all.</p><p>Yeah, she’d gone nude before, but as a Playmate she had a raw sex appeal that only her string of rock star exes had ever seen.</p><p>These women have been picked to peel off because they look amazing.</p><p>And we human beings like to look at amazing things.</p><p>Oh, and they also happen to BE amazing too.</p><p>Take Jordan Emanuel, the first black Playboy bunny to be made a Playmate of the Year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000569793370.jpg><p>When she isn’t showing us her incredible figure, she is fronting Women With Voices, “a platform of support, guidance and resources for all women from all walks of life”.</p><p>And let’s look at Nina Daniele, 2018’s winner, a breathtakingly beautiful brunette who also runs a boxing gym with classes for kids to learn motivation and confidence.</p><p>The list goes on — but I won’t.</p><p>Because it’s patronising, isn’t it? Having to justify that when a beautiful woman chooses to take her clothes off and show off her body it’s not the sum total of her being.</p><p>So thanks for the clarification, Playboy. Play on!</p><h2>Nudes had to look like shop workers</h2><h3>By Carrie Pitzulo, author and history professor</h3><p>IN 1955, Playboy’s subscription manager Charlaine Karalus posed topless for its founder Hugh Hefner’s newly conceived Playmate Of The Month feature under the pseudonym Janet Pilgrim – and became the first ever Playboy Playmate.</p><p>Rather than look like professional pin-ups, Heff wanted the girls who posed nude in his magazine to look like they could easily work in an office or shop.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000202415235.jpg><p>Lengthy written profiles accompanied the girls’ photographs and sometimes they were even photographed sitting eating dinner with their parents.</p><p>Society judged women by harsh sexual standards and the idea of sexualising the “good girl” was highly controversial.</p><p>But I don’t think Playboy has been given enough credit for opening up the idea that average women enjoy sex too.</p><p>The period after World War Two was a very conservative time in America.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000569797590-e1583964887369.jpg><p>Then in 1948, US sexologist Alfred Kinsey published a massive study of sexuality.</p><p>It showed that American men and women had a lot more sexual experiences than most were willing to admit to – affairs, same-sex experiences, multiple partners – and it made headline news.</p><p>Hefner was captivated by the exposé of sexual hypocrisy and wrote supportive editorials about Kinsey’s work in the student magazine that he edited at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000000532896.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN TV & SHOWBIZ</h2></p><p>When he launched Playboy in 1953 there were naked women in its pages but they made up less than 15 per cent of the magazine.</p><p>In those early days, Hefner was this nerdy guy and the rest of the magazine reflected his more highbrow interests, such as jazz, politics, travel, clothes, food and literature.</p><p>Throughout the 1970s the magazine featured writers such as Germaine Greer and took a progressive view on issues like the Pill and abortion.</p><span
