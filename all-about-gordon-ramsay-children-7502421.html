"Ramsay family definitely complete."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In September 2023, Gordon, who is known for his harsh demeanor on TV, told PEOPLE that his kids have "brought the emotion" out of him.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Tana’s super fierce, an ex-Montessori school teacher.

Gordon <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>celebrated the milestone</a> on Instagram, posting a photo of his daughter in her cap and gown in June 2019.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"So proud of this young Lady @megan__ramsay our first Ramsay ever to graduate with a degree&nbsp;@oxfordbrookes hard work pays off !" he captioned the photo.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While being the eldest comes with its perks, it also comes with its fair share of awkward moments. In January 2023, Gordon revealed on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>The Kelly Clarkson Show</a> that he not only thinks his daughter's boyfriend is "pathetic" but that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>he crashed their dinner date as well</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He was okay to begin with," the chef told host <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kelly Clarkson</a> of Megan's boyfriend Byron. "A bit wet. A little bit sort of ... you want a man to date your daughter and he was just, a little bit pathetic."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After getting Byron's phone number from Tilly, Gordon virtually intercepted Megan and Byron's date night with a FaceTime call, to which Bryon reportedly answered "shaking."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I said, 'Byron, it's me.

It also serves as a safe space for her to chat openly and honestly about her own mental health journey.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On the podcast, Holly shared that she was diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety and depression after she was sexually assaulted while attending Ravensbourne University, where she was studying fashion design. "I didn't tell anyone about it until a year afterwards. I just buried it in a box in the back of my mind," she told co-host and psychotherapist Talitha Fosh.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's confusing and I'm trying to take control of my narrative and use that to make something good," Holly said. Though she received love and support from her family, she added that "it's definitely a journey. But I hope that by speaking out I can help other people."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In December 2021, the podcaster and influencer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>celebrated one year of sobriety</a> with a heartfelt post on Instagram. "Today marks one year without alcohol. That is not something I thought I would ever say at the age of 21. However, by 21 (nearly 22) I never thought I would have been through half of what I have," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>she wrote</a>. "I chose to take a break from alcohol because it wasn't improving my mental health — which for me, comes first."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gordon commented on the post: "What an incredible young lady and words can't explain how proud you make me feel.

"Can't tell you enough how proud I am of this young man," the Hell's Kitchen star <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>captioned a photo</a> carousel of Jack dressed in uniform and posing with his family. "Jack Ramsay you've made me feel like the proudest father today."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Prior to joining the Royal Marines, Jack starred in four episodes of the 2019 British docuseries <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Born Famous</a>, which followed "the teenage offspring of some of Britain's most successful self-made celebrities given an opportunity to see how their famous parents used to live before fame and excess." According to his baby brother's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Instagram</a>, Jack also ran in the 2019 London Marathon.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During a joint <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>interview with GQ</a> that same year, Jack shared some of the lessons he learned from his famous father, including the importance of "work hard, play hard."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Sometimes I think you work harder, maybe too hard sometimes," he said. "But we have quality time together. We go for drives and we play sports. It's that balance that I find you always 100 percent get."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gordon interjected jokingly, "Also, I work hard because you're an expensive s---."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jack laughed and argued that his sisters were the expensive ones, to which Gordon responded: "You have a bed that was made out of a f------ car.

Tilly echoed the sentiment in her own birthday tribute: "I couldn't think of a better person to share this day with."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That isn't the only thing Tilly has in common with her dad; she also loves to cook and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>attempt TikTok challenges with Gordon</a>. At just 15 years old, she released her 60-recipe cookbook, Tilly's Kitchen Takeover.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"[My cooking is] a lot easier than [my dad's] because my recipes ... if you don't have one of the ingredients, it's not a big deal," Tilly said on the British TV program This Morning in 2017. "But with Dad's, if you don't have one of the ingredients, it doesn't work as well. His is a lot more fussy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From 2015 to 2019, Tilly had her own cooking reality show, Matilda and the Ramsay Bunch, on CBBC.

Happy new year from all the Ramsay's" on New Year's Day 2019. The video started with the Ramsay siblings wishing people a Happy New Year before panning to Tana, who cradled her growing bump.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-86 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Oscar is a rainbow baby, as the couple experienced a miscarriage in 2016, which Tana has been <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>very candid about</a> through the years.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-88 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The physical resemblance between Gordon and his youngest is uncanny, and a March 2022 <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>haircut of Oscar's further proved it</a>.
