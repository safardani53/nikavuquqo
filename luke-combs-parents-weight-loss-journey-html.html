The taunts and pokes thrown at him&nbsp;made him quite conscious. So three years ago, he embarked on a weight loss journey.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Accompanying the singer in this journey is his wife,&nbsp;Nicole Hocking. Their route and stops may not be the same, but their destination is.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Combs and His Wife's&nbsp;Weight Loss Journey</h2><p>Combs came into the limelight in late 2016, but, alongside fame, he also began <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">receiving</a> negative comments related to his weight. However, those mockings were not new to him as he had been constantly bullied for being overweight&nbsp;even before receiving fame. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Having said that, he had <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">started</a>&nbsp;his weight loss journey already circa 2015. He followed a hard diet for a month and lost around 12 pounds in January 2015. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>Then in early 2017,&nbsp;the singer shut down the negative comments passed at him once and for all. With trainer&nbsp;Kevin Klug's&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">help</a>, Combs got into a vigorous fitness schedule despite his busy career.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Klug</a>, according to his Instagram, is a personal trainer and founder of&nbsp;Klug Fitness.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Along with physical fitness, Combs&nbsp;temporarily&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">changed</a> his diet. He switched his diet after losing&nbsp;a football bet with&nbsp;his keyboard player, Neil Tankersley. However, he could not follow the vegan diet and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">failed</a>&nbsp;at it after just 30 days. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Did I honor the bet for the whole 90 days? No, I did not. I made it just over a month and I just was like, 'Man, I don't really want to do this anymore.' So I made the bet with my keys player anyways, and I really debated on just firing him if I had to do the whole 90 days. So no, he was cool with me giving up.</p><p>Despite trying his best to stay on track, the Lovin' On You singer still got trolled over his weight after his now-wife Nicole&nbsp;Combs&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">uploaded</a> a picture of the two with a caption, "hey, you're hot." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But, this time, the mocking crossed the line as it was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">targeted</a> at their relationship. So, Nicole spoke up and defended her man. She slammed all the negative comments&nbsp;as she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tweeted</a> a meme of a Facebook Marketplace ad for ‘these hands’ and captioned: "To everyone currently being less than pleasant to me on Twitter for dating a bigger guy."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>She then <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">urged</a> people in the same tweet to let&nbsp;go of the double standards. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Speaking of his wife, Nicole Hocking — whom Luke <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">engaged</a> in 2018 and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">married on</a> August 1, 2020 — has also been keen on losing her weight for a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">long time</a>.</p><p>However, much like her husband, she too hasn’t been able to control herself and stick to her diet plan. For instance, in a tweet of August 2, 2017, she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a>&nbsp;she would like to lose weight but couldn’t give up on wine and pizza.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>I would like to lose weight but I refuse to give up wine & pizza. Non-negotiable. — NICOLE COMBS âœ¨ (@nicohocking) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">August 3, 2017</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><h2>From A Local Bar Singer To A Renowned Country Singer</h2><p>Although he slowly lost his weight, Luke Combs&nbsp;didn't lose his vocal talent.&nbsp;Thanks to his relatable songs,&nbsp;his fan-following is growing with each passing day. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He has over 2.2 million subscribers plus 1.97&nbsp;billion views in his self-titled <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">YouTube channel</a> and over 3.5 million followers on his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a> handle. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Luke's amazing singing talent was first <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">recognized</a> in 2016 by songwriter Jonathan Singleton when Combs was singing his original song 'Hurricane' in a local bar in Nashville.</p><p>As a local boy, he had already maintained an excellent reputation for himself, and when he walked up to the stage, Jonathan got shocked by the buzz Luke received. Seeing his popularity and talent, Jonathan decided to work with Luke and&nbsp;eventually signed a deal with him.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Luke then released his song 'Hurricane' to the global audience, which later became triple platinum.</p><p>Since then, Nashville's local&nbsp;boy has never looked back and has continued to give his best in every song/album that he has made. His talent was further honored when he was nominated for the 2019's Grammy Awards in the category of 'best new artist.'</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Some of Luke's hit songs are 'When It Rains It Pours,'&nbsp;'One Number Away,'&nbsp;'She Got the Best Of Me,'&nbsp;and 'Beautiful Crazy.' On November 8, 2019, Luke released his new album entitled 'What You See Is What You Get,' which had 17 songs.</p><h2>Luke&nbsp;Dedicates His Success To His Parents</h2><p>Combs is as humble as one can get. He wholeheartedly dedicates all of his success to his parents, father&nbsp;Chester Combs, and mother,&nbsp;Rhonda Combs.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He has now had seven consecutive No. 1&nbsp;singles, sold-out tours, and a platinum-selling debut album, all of which has helped him rake&nbsp;in big bucks thanks to his encouraging mother.</p><p>While talking about his mother’s involvement in his musical career with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Pop Culture</a> on March 4, 2020, the singer stated that his mother suggested he play guitar and start a musical career. A mother's push was all that was needed.&nbsp;He began writing songs and playing them to an audience, first in his hometown and then to people worldwide.</p><p>Luke dedicates all his success to his supportive parents. And he is happy he can support his guardians financially to travel around places and experience things they always wanted to do.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinqKiloa6ze8uuop5lk6S6o7%2BMqZirnZ6pwG7DxKKeoaxdoby0v4yjpq6qnprGb7TTpqM%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fluke-combs-parents-weight-loss-journey-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fluke-combs-parents-weight-loss-journey-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fluke-combs-parents-weight-loss-journey-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fluke-combs-parents-weight-loss-journey-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fluke-combs-parents-weight-loss-journey-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fluke-combs-parents-weight-loss-journey-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./primal-groudon-raid-guide-pokemon-go.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./primal-groudon-raid-guide-pokemon-go.html>Primal Groudon Raid Guide for Pokmon GO</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./imaray-ulloa-yrd8-html.html>Imaray Ulloa (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./imaray-ulloa-yrd8-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
